<h2>INTRODUCTORY OF REVISED EDITION.</h2>


<p>It is not yet quite ten years since the publication of “<span class="smcap">Common
Sense in the Household. General Receipts.</span>” In
offering the work to the publishers, under whose able management
it has prospered so wonderfully, I said: “I have written
this because I felt that such a Manual of Practical Housewifery
is needed.” That I judged aright, taking my own experience
as a housekeeper as the criterion of the wants and perplexities
of others, is abundantly proved by the circumstance which calls
for this new and revised edition of the book. Through much
and constant use—nearly 100,000 copies having been printed
from them—the stereotype plates have become so worn that
the impressions are faint and sometimes illegible. I gladly
avail myself of the opportunity thus offered to re-read and so
far to alter the original volume as may, in the light of later
improvements in the culinary art and in my understanding of
it, make the collection of family receipts more intelligible and
available. Nor have I been able to resist the temptation to
interpolate a few excellent receipts that have come into my
hands at a later period than that of the publication of the last,
and in my estimation, perhaps the most valuable of the “Common
Sense Series,” viz.: “<span class="smcap">The Dinner Year-Book.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I am grateful, also, to the courtesy of my publishers for the
privilege of thanking those to whom this book was, and is
dedicated, “My fellow-housekeepers—North, East, South and
West”—for their substantial endorsement of the work I have
done in their behalf. A collection of the private letters I have
received from those who have used the “General Receipts”
would make a volume very nearly as large as this. If I have,
as the writers of these testimonials assure me—“done them
good,”—they have done me more in letting me know that I
have not spent my strength for naught. I acknowledge with
pleasure sundry pertinent suggestions and inquiries which
have led me, in this revision, to examine warily the phraseology
of some receipts and to modify these, I believe, for the better.
But, by far, the best “good” done me through this work
has been the conscious sisterhood into which I have come with
the great body of American housewives. This is a benefit not
to be rated by dollars and cents, or measured by time. I hope
my fellow-workers will find their old kitchen-companion, in
fresh dress, yet more serviceable than before, and that their
daughters may, at the close of a second decade, demand new
stereotype plates for still another, and, like this, a progressive
edition.</p>

<h2>FAMILIAR TALK<br />

<small>WITH MY</small><br />

FELLOW-HOUSEKEEPER AND READER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A talk</span> as woman to woman, in which each shall say,
“I” and “you,” and “my dear,” and “you know,” as freely
as she pleases. It would not be a womanly chat if we
omitted these forms of expression. An informal preface
to what I mean shall be an informal book—bristling with
“I’s” all the way through. If said bristles offend the
critic’s touch, let him remember that this work is not prepared
for the library, but for readers who trouble themselves
little about editorial “we’s” and the circumlocutions
of literary modesty.</p>

<p>I wish it were in my power to bring you, the prospective
owner of this volume, in person, as I do in spirit, to
my side on this winter evening, when the bairnies are
“folded like the flocks;” the orders for breakfast committed
to the keeping of Bridget, or Gretchen, or Chloe, or
the plans for the morrow definitely laid in the brain of
that ever-busy, but most independent of women, the
housekeeper who “does her own work.” I should perhaps
summon to our cozy conference a very weary companion—weary
of foot, of hand—and I should not deserve to be
your confidant, did I not know how often heart-weary with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
discouragement; with much producing of ways and means;
with a certain despondent looking forward to the monotonous
grinding of the household machine; to the certainty,
proved by past experience, that toilsome as has been this
day, the morrow will prove yet more abundant in labors,
in trials of strength and nerves and temper. You would
tell me what a dreary problem this of “woman’s work
that is never done” is to your fainting soul. How, try
as you may and as you do to be systematic and diligent,
something is always “turning up” in the treadmill to keep
you on the strain. How you often say to yourself, in bitterness
of spirit, that it is a mistake of Christian civilization
to educate girls into a love of science and literature,
and then condemn them to the routine of a domestic
drudge. You do not see, you say, that years of scholastic
training will make you a better cook, a better wife or
mother. You have seen the time—nay, many times since
assuming your present position—when you would have
exchanged your knowledge of ancient and modern languages,
belles-lettres, music, and natural science, for the
skill of a competent kitchen-maid. The “learning how”
is such hard work! Labor, too, uncheered by encouraging
words from mature housewives, unsoftened by sympathy
even from your husband, or your father or brother,
or whoever may be the “one” to whom you “make home
lovely.” It may be that, in utter discouragement, you
have made up your mind that you have “no talent for
these things.”</p>

<p>I have before me now the picture of a wife, the mother
of four children, who, many years ago, sickened me for all
time with that phrase. In a slatternly morning-gown at
four in the afternoon, leaning back in the laziest and most
ragged of rocking-chairs, dust on the carpet, on the open
piano, the mantel, the mirrors, even on her own hair, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rubbed the soft palm of one hand with the grimy fingers
of the other, and with a sickly-sweet smile whined out—</p>

<p>“Now, I am one of the kind who have no talent for
such things! The kitchen and housework and sewing are
absolutely hateful to me—utterly uncongenial to my turn
of mind. The height of my earthly ambition is to have
nothing to do but to paint on velvet all day!”</p>

<p>I felt then, in the height of my indignant disgust, that
there was propriety as well as wit in the “Spectator’s”
suggestion that every young woman should, before fixing
the wedding-day, be compelled by law to exhibit to inspectors
a prescribed number of useful articles as her outfit—napery,
bed-linen, clothing, etc., made by her own
hands, and that it would be wise legislation which should
add to these proofs of her fitness for her new sphere a
practical knowledge of housework and cookery.</p>

<p>If you have not what our Yankee grandmothers termed
a “faculty” for housewifery—yet are obliged, as is the
case with an immense majority of American women, to
conduct the affairs of a household, bills of fare included—there
is the more reason for earnest application to your
profession. If the natural taste be dull, lay to it more
strength of will—resolution born of a just sense of the importance
of the knowledge and dexterity you would acquire.
Do not scoff at the word “profession.” Call not
that common and unclean which Providence has designated
as your life-work. I speak not now of the labors of the
culinary department alone; but, without naming the
other duties which you and you only can perform, I
do insist that upon method, skill, economy in the kitchen,
depends so much of the well-being of the rest of the household,
that it may safely be styled the root—the foundation
of housewifery. I own it would be pleasanter in most
cases, especially to those who have cultivated a taste for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
intellectual pursuits, to live above the heat and odor of this
department. It must be very fine to have an efficient
aide-de-camp in the person of a French cook, or a competent
sub-manager, or an accomplished head-waiter who
receives your orders for the day in your boudoir or library,
and executes the same with zeal and discretion that leave
you no room for anxiety or regret. Such mistresses do
not need cookery-books. The few—and it must be borne
in mind that in this country these are <i>very</i> few—born in
an estate like this would not comprehend what I am now
writing; would not enter into the depths of that compassionate
yearning which moves me as I think of what I
have known for myself in the earlier years of my wedded
life, what I have heard and seen in other households of
honest intentions brought to contempt; of ill-directed
toil; of mortification, and the heavy, wearing sense of inferiority
that puts the novice at such a woful disadvantage
in a community of notable managers.</p>

<p>There is no use in enlarging upon this point. You and
I might compare experiences by the hour without exhausting
our store.</p>

<p>“And then”—you sigh, with a sense of resentment upon
you, however amiable your disposition, for the provocation
is dire—“cookery-books and young housekeepers’ assistants,
and all that sort of thing, are such humbugs!—Dark
lanterns at best—too often Will-o’-the-wisps.”</p>

<p>My dear, would you mind handing me the book which
lies nearest you on the table there? “Dickens?” Of
course. You will usually find something of his in every
room in this house—almost as surely as you will a Bible.
It rests and refreshes one to pick him up at odd times, and
dip in anywhere. Hear the bride, Mrs. John Rokesmith,
upon our common grievance.</p>

<p>“She was under the constant necessity of referring for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
advice and support to a sage volume, entitled ‘The Complete
British Family Housewife,’ which she would sit consulting,
with her elbows upon the table, and her temples in
her hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring over the
Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British
Housewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no
means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness
in the British tongue, and sometimes might have
issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamtchatkan
language.”</p>

<p>Don’t interrupt me, my long-suffering sister! There is
more of the same sort to come.</p>

<p>“There was likewise a coolness on the part of ‘The
Complete British Housewife’ which Mrs. John Rokesmith
found highly exasperating. She would say, ‘Take
a salamander,’ as if a general should command a private
to catch a Tartar. Or, she would casually issue the
order, ‘Throw in a handful’ of something entirely unattainable.
In these, the housewife’s most glaring moments
of unreason, Bella would shut her up and knock her on
the table, apostrophizing her with the compliment—‘O
you ARE a stupid old donkey! Where am I to get it,
do you think?’”</p>

<p>When I took possession of my first real home, the prettily
furnished cottage to which I came as a bride, more
full of hope and courage than if I had been wiser, five
good friends presented me with as many cookery-books,
each complete, and all by different compilers. One day’s
investigation of my <i>ménage</i> convinced me that my lately-hired
servants knew no more about cookery than I did, or
affected stupidity to develop my capabilities or ignorance.
Too proud to let them suspect the truth, or to have it
bruited abroad as a topic for pitying or contemptuous
gossip, I shut myself up with <i>my</i> “Complete Housewives,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and inclined seriously to the study of the same, comparing
one with the other, and seeking to shape a theory
which should grow into practice in accordance with the
best authority. I don’t like to remember that time! The
question of disagreeing doctors, and the predicament of
falling between two stools, are trivial perplexities when
compared with my strife and failure.</p>

<p>Said the would-be studious countryman to whom a mischievous
acquaintance lent “Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary”
as an entertaining volume,—“I wrastled, and I
wrastled, <i>and</i> I wrastled with it, but I couldn’t get up
much of an int’rest.”</p>

<p>My wrestling begat naught save pitiable confusion,
hopeless distress, and a three-days’ sick headache, during
which season I am not sure that I did not darkly contemplate
suicide as the only sure escape from the meshes that
girt me. At the height—or depth—of my despondency a
friend, one with a great heart and steady brain, came to
my rescue. Her cheerful laugh over my dilemma rings
down to me now, through all these years, refreshingly as
it then saluted my ears.</p>

<p>“Bless your innocent little heart!” she cried, in her
fresh, gay voice, “Ninety-nine out of a hundred cookbooks
are written by people who never kept house, and
the hundredth by a good cook who yet doesn’t know how
to express herself to the enlightenment of others. Compile
a receipt book for yourself. Make haste slowly.
Learn one thing at a time, and when you have mastered
it, ‘make a note on it,’ as Captain Cuttle says—never losing
sight of the principle that you <i>must do it in order to
learn how</i>.”</p>

<p>Then she opened to me her own neatly-written “Manual”—the
work of years, recommending, as I seized it
that I should commence my novitiate with simple dishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the beginning of the hoard of practical receipts
I now offer for your inspection. For twenty years,
I have steadily pursued this work, gleaning here and sifting
there, and levying such remorseless contributions upon
my friends, that I fear the sight of my paper and pencil
has long since become a bugbear. For the kindness and
courtesy which have been my invariable portion in this
quest, I hereby return hearty thanks. For the encouraging
words and good wishes that have ever answered the
hint of my intention to collect what had proved so valuable
to me into a printed volume, I declare myself to be
yet more a debtor. I do not claim for my compend the
proud pre-eminence of the “Complete American Housewife.”
It is no boastful system of “Cookery Taught in
Twelve Lessons.” And I should write myself down a
knave or a fool, were I to assert that a raw cook or ignorant
mistress can, by half-a-day’s study of my collection,
equal Soyer or Blot, or even approximate the art of a
half-taught scullion.</p>

<p>We may as well start from the right point, if we hope
to continue friends. You must learn the rudiments of
the art for yourself. Practice, and practice alone, will
teach you certain essentials. The management of the
ovens, the requisite thickness of boiling custards, the right
shade of brown upon bread and roasted meats—these and
dozens of other details are hints which cannot be imparted
by written or oral instructions. But, once learned, they
are never forgotten, and henceforward your fate is in your
own hands. You are mistress of yourself, though servants
leave. Have faith in your own abilities. You will be a
better cook for the mental training you have received at
school and from books. Brains tell everywhere, to say
nothing of intelligent observation, just judgment, a faithful
memory, and orderly habits. Consider that you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a profession, as I said just now, and resolve to understand
it in all its branches. My book is designed to help you.
I believe it will, if for no other reason, because it has
been a faithful guide to myself—a reference beyond value
in seasons of doubt and need. I have brought every receipt
to the test of common sense and experience. Those
which I have not tried myself were obtained from trustworthy
housewives—the best I know. I have enjoyed the
task heartily, and from first to last the persuasion has
never left me that I was engaged in a good cause.
Throughout I have had you, my dear sister, present before
me, with the little plait between your brows, the
wistful look about eye and mouth that reveal to me, as
words could not, your desire to “do your best.”</p>

<p>“In a humble home, and in a humble way,” I hear you
add, perhaps. You “are not ambitious;” you “only want
to help John, and to make him and the children comfortable
and happy.”</p>

<p>Heaven reward your honest, loyal endeavors! Would
you mind if I were to whisper a word in your ear I don’t
care to have progressive people hear?—although progress
is a grand thing when it takes the right direction. My
dear, John and the children, and the humble home, make
your sphere for the present, you say. Be sure you fill it—<i>full</i>!
before you seek one wider and higher. There is no
better receipt between these covers than that. Leave the
rest to God. Everybody knows those four lines of George
Herbert’s, which ought to be framed and hung up in the
work-room of every house:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A servant, with this clause,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Makes drudgery divine;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Makes that and th’ action fine.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I wonder if the sainted poet knows—in that land where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
drudgery is one of the rough places forever overpast, and
work is unmingled blessing—to how many sad and striving
hearts those words have brought peace?</p>

<p>And by way of helping John, not only by saving money
and preparing palatable and wholesome dishes for his
table, but by sparing the wife he loves many needless steps
and much hurtful care, will you heed a homely hint or
two relative to the practice of your art? Study method,
and economy of time and strength, no less than of materials.
I take it for granted that you are too intelligent
to share in the vulgar prejudice against labor-saving machines.
A raisin-seeder costs a trifle in comparison with
the time and patience required to stone the fruit in the
old way. A <i>good</i> egg-beater—the Dover, for instance—is
a treasure. So with farina-kettles, syllabub churns,
apple-corers, potato-peelers and slicers, clothes wringers
and sprinklers, and the like. Most of these are made of
tin—are therefore cheap and easily kept clean. Let each
article have its own place in the closet and kitchen,
to which restore it so soon as you have done using it.
Before undertaking the preparation of any dish, read
over the receipt carefully, unless you are thoroughly
familiar with the manufacture of it. Many excellent
housewives have a fashion of saying loftily, when asked
how such things are made—“I carry all my receipts in my
head. I never wrote out one in my life.”</p>

<p>And you, if timid and self-distrustful, are smitten with
shame, keep your receipt-book out of sight, and cram
your memory with ingredients and measures, times and
weights, for fear Mrs. Notable should suspect you of rawness
and inefficiency. Whereas the truth is, that if you
have a mind worthy of the name, its powers are too valuable
to be laden with such details. Master the general
principles, as I said just now, and for particulars look to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
your marching-orders. Having refreshed your memory
by this reference, pick out from your household stores,
and set in convenient order, within reach of your hand,
everything you will need in making ready the particular
compound under consideration. Then, take your stand
in the midst—or sit, if you can. It is common sense—oftentimes
a pious duty, to take judicious care of your
physical health. I lay it down as a safe and imperative
rule for kitchen use—<i>Never stand when you can do your
work as well while sitting</i>. If I could have John’s ear for
a minute, I would tell him that which would lead him to
watch you and exercise wholesome authority in this
regard.</p>

<p>Next, prepare each ingredient for mixing, that the
bread, cake, pudding, soup, or ragoût may not be delayed
when half finished because the flour is not sifted, or the
“shortening” warmed, the sugar and butter are not
creamed, the meat not cut up, or the herbs not minced.
Don’t begin until you are ready; then go steadily forward,
“without haste, without rest,” and think of what
you are doing.</p>

<p>“Dickens again?”</p>

<p>Why not, since there is no more genial and pertinent
philosopher of common life and every-day subjects? To
quote, then—</p>

<p>“It was a maxim of Captain Swosser’s,” said Mrs.
Badger, “speaking in his figurative, naval manner, that
when you make pitch hot, you cannot make it too hot,
and that if you have only to swab a plank, you should
swab it as if Davy Jones were after you. It appears to
me that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as
the nautical profession.”</p>

<p>“To all professions!” observed Mr. Badger. “It was
admirably said by Captain Swosser; beautifully said!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>But it will sometimes happen that when you have
heated your pitch, or swabbed your deck, or made your
pudding according to the lights set before you, the result
is a failure. This is especially apt to occur in a maiden
effort. You have wasted materials and time, and suffered,
moreover, acute demoralization—are enwrapped in a wet
blanket of discouragement, instead of the seemly robe of
complacency. Yet no part of the culinary education is
more useful, if turned to proper account, than this very
discipline of failure. It is a stepping-stone to excellence—sharp,
it is true, but often sure. You have learned how
<i>not</i> to do it right, which is the next thing to success. It
is pretty certain that you will avoid, in your second essay,
the rock upon which you have split this time. And, after
all, there are few failures which are utter and irremediable.
Scorched soups and custards, sour bread, biscuit
yellow with soda, and cake heavy as lead, come under the
head of “hopeless.” They are absolutely unfit to be set
before civilized beings and educated stomachs. Should
such mishaps occur, lock the memory of the attempt in
your own bosom, and do not vex or amuse John and your
guests with the narration, still less with visible proof of
the calamity. Many a partial failure would pass unobserved
but for the clouded brow and earnest apologies of
the hostess. Do not apologize except at the last gasp!
If there is but one chance in ten that a single person present
may not discover the deficiency which has changed
all food on the table to dust and gravel-stones to you,
trust to the one chance, and carry off the matter bravely.
You will be astonished to find, if you keep your wits
about you how often even your husband will remain in
blissful ignorance that aught has gone wrong, if you do
not tell him. You know so well what should have been
the product of your labor that you exaggerate the justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of others’ perceptions. Console yourself, furthermore,
with the reflection that yours is not the first failure upon
record, nor the million-and-first, and that there will be
as many to-morrows as there have been yesterdays.</p>

<p>Don’t add to a trifling <i>contretemps</i> the real discomfort
of a discontented or fretful wife. Say blithely, if John
note your misfortune—“I hope to do better another time,”
and do not be satisfied until you have redeemed your
pledge. Experience and your quick wit will soon teach
you how to avert impending evils of this nature, how to
snatch your preparations from imminent destruction, and,
by ingenious correctives or concealments, to make them
presentable. These you will soon learn for yourself if you
keep before you the truism I have already written, to wit,
that few failures are beyond repair.</p>

<p>Never try experiments for the benefit of invited guests
nor, when John is at home, risk the success of your meal
upon a new dish. Have something which you know he
can eat, and introduce experiments as by-play. But do
not be too shy of innovations in the shape of untried dishes.
Variety is not only pleasant, but healthful. The least
pampered palate will weary of stereotyped bills of fare. It
is an idea which should have been exploded long ago, that
plain roast, boiled, and fried, on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, cod-fish on Friday, with pork-and-beans
every Saturday, are means of grace, because
economical. And with this should have vanished the prejudice
against warmed-over meals—or <i>réchauffés</i>, as our
French friends term them. I have tried, in the following
pages, to set forth the attractions of these, and their claims
to your attention as being savory, economical, nourishing,
and often elegant. In preparing these acceptably, everything
depends upon your own taste and skill. Season with
judgment, cook just enough and not a minute too long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and dish nicely. The recommendation of the eye to the
palate is a point no cook can afford to disregard. If you
can offer an unexpected visitor nothing better than bread-and-butter
and cold ham, he will enjoy the luncheon twice
as much if the bread be sliced thinly and evenly, spread
smoothly, each slice folded in the middle upon the buttered
surface, and piled symmetrically; if the ham be also cut
thin, scarcely thicker than a wafer, and garnished with
parsley, cresses, or curled lettuce. Set on mustard and
pickles; let the table-cloth and napkin be white and glossy;
the glass clear, and plate shining clean; and add to these
accessories to comfort a bright welcome, and, my word for
it, you need fear no dissatisfaction on his part, however
epicurean may be his tastes. Should your cupboard be
bare of aught more substantial than crackers and cheese,
do not yield to dismay; split the crackers (if splittable),
toast the inside lightly, and butter while hot. Grate your
cheese into a powdery mound, garnishing the edges of the
plate. If you have no beverage except water to set before
him, let this be cool, and pour it out for him yourself,
into an irreproachable glass. A dirty table-cloth, a
smeared goblet, or a sticky plate, will spoil the most luxurious
feast. A table well set is half-spread.</p>

<p>I have not said one-tenth of that which is pressing upon
my heart and mind, yet I fear you may think me trite and
tedious. One suggestion more, and we will proceed to the
details of business.</p>

<p>I believe that, so far as care can avail in securing such
a result, my receipts are accurate. But in the matter of
seasoning and other minor details, consult your judgment
and John’s taste. Take this liberty with whatever receipt
you think you can improve. If I chance to find in your
work-basket, or upon the kitchen dresser, a well-thumbed
copy of my beloved “Common Sense,” with copious annotations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in the margin, I shall, so far from feeling wounded,
be flattered in having so diligent a student, and, with your
permission, shall engraft the most happy suggestions upon
the next edition.</p>

<p>For the speedy issue of which, the petitioner doth humbly
pray.</p>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In looking over this book the reader will notice certain receipts
marked thus—✠. I do not claim for these greater merit than
should of right be accorded to many others. I merely wish to call
the attention of the novice to them as certainly safe, and for the
most part simple. Every one thus marked has been tried by myself;
most of them are in frequent, some in daily use, in my own
family.</p>

<p>My reason for thus singling out comparatively a small number of
receipts from the rest, is the recollection of my own perplexities—the
loss of time and patience to which I have been subjected in the
examination of a new cookery-book, with an eye to immediate use
of the directions laid down for various dishes. I have often and
vainly wished for a finger-board to guide me in my search for those
which were easy and sure, and which would result satisfactorily.
This sort of directory I have endeavored to supply, taking care,
however, to inform the reader in advance that, so far as I know,
there is not an unsafe receipt in the whole work.</p>

<p>Of course it was not necessary or expedient to append the above
sign to plain “roast and boiled,” which are in common use everywhere.</p></div>

<h2>SOUPS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> base of your soup should always be uncooked
meat. To this may be added, if you like, cracked bones
of cooked game, or of underdone beef or mutton; but
for flavor and nourishment, depend upon the juices of
the meat which was put in raw. Cut this into small
pieces, and beat the bone until it is fractured at every
inch of its length. Put them on in cold water, without
salt, and heat very slowly. <i>Do not boil fast at any stage
of the operation.</i> Keep the pot covered, and do not add
the salt until the meat is thoroughly done, as it has a
tendency to harden the fibres, and restrain the flow of
the juices. Strain—always through a cullender, after
which clear soups should be filtered through a hair-sieve
or coarse bobbinet lace. The bag should not be
squeezed.</p>

<p>It is slovenly to leave rags of meat, husks of vegetables
and bits of bone in the tureen. Do not uncover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
until you are ready to ladle out the soup. Do this
neatly and quickly, having your soup-plates heated beforehand.</p>

<p>Most soups are better the second day than the first,
unless they are warmed over too quickly or left too long
upon the fire after they are hot. In the one case they
are apt to scorch; in the other they become insipid.</p>



<h3>VEGETABLE SOUPS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea.</span> (No. 1.) ✠</h3>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. beef—cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>½ peck of green peas.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>½ cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper and chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>


<p>Boil the empty pods of the peas in the water one
hour before putting in the beef. Strain them out, add
the beef, and boil slowly for an hour and a half longer.
Half an hour before serving, add the shelled peas; and
twenty minutes later, the rice-flour, with salt, pepper and
parsley. After adding the rice-flour, stir frequently, to
prevent scorching. Strain into a hot tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea</span> (No. 2.)</h3>


<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 qts. of strong veal or beef broth.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>½ teaspoonful sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 qt. shelled peas.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bring the broth to a boil; put in the peas, and boil
for twenty minutes. Add the sugar, and a sprig of
green mint. Boil a quarter of an hour more, and stir
in the butter, with pepper and salt, if the broth be not
sufficiently salted already. Strain before serving, and
send to table with small squares of toasted bread floating
upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea</span> (<i>dried</i>). ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>1 qt. split peas, which have been soaked over night.</li>
<li>1 lb. salt pork, cut into bits an inch square.</li>
<li>1 lb. beef, cut into bits an inch square.</li>
<li>Celery and sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put over the fire, and boil slowly for two hours, or
until the quantity of liquor does not exceed two quarts.
Pour into a cullender, and press the peas through it
with a wooden or silver spoon. Return the soup to the
pot, adding a small head of celery, chopped up, a little
parsley, or, if preferred, summer savory or sweet marjoram.
Have ready three or four slices of bread (stale)
which have been fried in butter until they are brown;
cut into slices and scatter them upon the surface of the
soup after it is poured into the tureen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pea and Tomato.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is made according to either of the foregoing receipts,
in summer with green—in winter with dried and
split peas. Just before straining the soup, add a quart
of tomatoes, which have already been stewed soft; let
the whole come to a good boil, and strain as above directed.
If the stewed tomato be watery, strain off the
superfluous liquid before pouring into the pea soup, or
it will be too thin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean</span> (<i>dried.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>The beans used for this purpose may be the ordinary
kidney, the rice or field bean, or, best of all, the French
mock-turtle soup bean. Soak a quart of these over
night in soft lukewarm water; put them over the fire
next morning, with one gallon of cold water and about
two pounds of salt pork. Boil slowly for three hours,
keeping the pot well covered; shred into it a head of
celery, add pepper—cayenne, if preferred—simmer half
an hour longer, strain through a cullender, and serve,
with slices of lemon passed to each guest.</p>

<p>Mock-turtle beans, treated in this way, yield a very
fair substitute for the fine calf’s-head soup known by
the same name.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean and Corn.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is a winter soup, and is made of white beans
prepared according to the foregoing receipt, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the addition of a quart of dried or canned corn. If the
former is used—and the Shaker sweet corn is nearly,
salted corn quite as good for the purpose as the more
expensive canned green corn—soak it overnight in warm
water—changing this early in the morning, and pouring
on more warm water, barely enough to cover the corn,
and keeping it in a close vessel until ready to put on
the beans. Let all boil together, with pork as in the
bean soup proper. Strain out as usual, rubbing hard
through the cullender. Some persons have a habit of
neglecting the use of the cullender in making bean soup,
and serving it like stewed beans which have been imperfectly
drained. The practice is both slovenly and
unwholesome, since the husks of the cereal are thus imposed
upon the digestive organs of the eater, with no
additional nutriment. To the beans and corn may be
added a pint of stewed tomato, if desired.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus</span> (<i>White soup.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. veal. The knuckle is best.</li>
<li>3 bunches asparagus, as well bleached as you can procure.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>1 cup milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful rice flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut off the hard green stem, and put half of the tender
heads of the asparagus into the water with the meat. Boil
in closely covered pot for three hours, until the meat is
in rags and the asparagus dissolved. Strain the liquor
and return to the pot, with the remaining half of the asparagus
heads. Let this boil for twenty minutes more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and add, before taking up, a cup of sweet milk (cream is
better) in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour,
arrow-root, or corn-starch. When it has fairly
boiled up, serve without further straining, with small
squares of toast in the tureen. Season with salt and
pepper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus</span> (<i>Green soup.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. veal—cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork.</li>
<li>3 bunches asparagus.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the entire stalk of the asparagus into pieces an inch
long, and when the meat has boiled one hour, add half of
the vegetable to the liquor in the pot. Boil two hours
longer and strain, pressing the asparagus pulp very hard
to extract all the green coloring. Add the other half of
the asparagus—(the heads only, which should be kept in
cold water until you are ready for them), and boil twenty
minutes more. Then proceed as with the asparagus white
soup, omitting the milk, thickening, and salt. The pork
will supply the latter seasoning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato</span> (<i>Winter soup.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. beef.</li>
<li>1 qt. canned tomatoes.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>A little onion.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let the meat and water boil for two hours, until the
liquid is reduced to little more than two quarts. Then
stir in the tomatoes, and stew all slowly for three-quarters
of an hour longer. Season to taste, strain, and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato</span> (<i>Summer soup</i>). ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2½ lbs. veal, or lamb.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>2 qts. fresh tomatoes, peeled and cut up fine.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt. Chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the meat to shreds and the water down to two
quarts. Strain the liquor, put in the tomatoes, stirring
them very hard that they may dissolve thoroughly; boil
half an hour. Season with parsley or any other green
herb you may prefer, pepper, and salt. Strain again, and
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with a teaspoonful of
white sugar, before pouring into the tureen.</p>

<p>This soup is more palatable still if made with the broth
in which chickens were boiled for yesterday’s dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turnip.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Knuckle of veal, well cracked.</li>
<li>5 qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover closely and stew gently for four hours, the day
before the soup is wanted. On the morrow, skim off the
fat and warm the stock gradually to a boil. Have ready
an onion and six large winter or a dozen small summer
turnips, sweet marjoram or thyme minced very finely.
Put these into the soup and let them simmer together for
an hour. Strain: return to the fire and add a cup of
milk—in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour
or other thickening—and a tablespoonful of butter.
Season with salt and pepper, let it boil up once, stirring
all the time, as is necessary in all soups where milk is
added at last, and remove instantly, or it will scorch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>A dozen large mealy potatoes.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>1 lb. salt pork.</li>
<li>3 qts. water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 cup milk or cream.</li>
<li>1 well-beaten egg.</li>
<li>Chopped onion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the pork in the clear water for an hour and a half,
then take it out. Have ready the potatoes, which, after
being peeled and sliced, should lie in cold water for half an
hour. Throw them into the pot, with the chopped onion.
Cover and boil three-quarters of an hour, stirring often.
Beat in butter, milk and egg. Add the latter ingredients
carefully, a little at a time; stir while it heats to a final
boil, and then serve.</p>

<p>This is a cheap wholesome dish, and more palatable
than one would suppose from reading the receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 onions.</li>
<li>3 carrots.</li>
<li>4 turnips.</li>
<li>1 small cabbage.</li>
<li>1 bunch celery.</li>
<li>1 pt. stewed tomatoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop all the vegetables, except the tomatoes and cabbage,
very finely, and set them over the fire with rather
over three quarts of water. They should simmer gently
for half an hour, at the end of which time the cabbage
must be added, having previously been parboiled and
chopped up. In fifteen minutes more put in the tomatoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and a bunch of sweet herbs, and give all a lively boil of
twenty minutes. Rub through a cullender, return the
soup to the fire, stir in a good tablespoonful of butter,
pepper, and salt, half a cup of cream if you have it,
thickened with corn-starch; let it boil up, and it is ready
for the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ochra, or Gumbo.</span></h3>

<p>Ochra, or <i>okra</i>, is a vegetable little known except in
the far South, where it is cultivated in large quantities
and is very popular. A favorite soup is prepared from it
in the following manner:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 qts. of ochras, sliced thin.</li>
<li>1 qt. of tomatoes, also sliced.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of beef, cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>½ lb. corned ham or pork, also cut up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the meat and ochras together in a pot with a quart
of cold water—just enough to cover them—and let them
stew for an hour. Then add the tomatoes and two quarts
of <i>boiling</i> water—more, if the liquid in the pot has boiled
away so as to expose the meat and vegetables. Boil three-quarters
of an hour longer, skimming often with a <i>silver</i>
spoon. When the contents of the vessel are boiled to
pieces, put in the butter, with cayenne pepper and salt,
if the ham has not seasoned it sufficiently. Strain and
send up with squares of light, crisp toast floating upon
it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 large fowl, cut into eight pieces.</li>
<li>1 doz. ears green corn—cut from the cobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the chicken with the cobs in a gallon of water
until the fowl is tender—if tough, the boiling must be
slow and long. Then, put the corn into the pot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stew an hour longer—still gently. Remove the chicken
with a cupful of the liquid, if you wish to make other use
of the meat. Set this aside, take out the cobs, season the
corn-soup with pepper, salt, and parsley; thicken with
rice or wheat flour, boil up once, and serve without straining,
if the corn be young and tender.</p>

<p>A tolerable fricassee may be made of the chicken, unless
it has boiled to rags, by beating up an egg and a
tablespoonful of butter, adding this to the cupful of reserved
liquor from which the corn must be strained. Boil
this for a moment, thicken with flour, throw in a little
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; pour, while scalding,
over the chicken, which you have arranged in a dish;
garnish with circular slices of hard-boiled eggs and curled
parsley.</p>



<h3>MEAT SOUPS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Soup</span> (<i>à la Julienne</i>). ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 lbs. of lean beef. The shin is a good piece for this purpose. Have the bones well cracked, carefully extracting the marrow, every bit of which should be put into the soup.</li>
<li>6 qts. of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stock must be prepared the day before the soup is
needed. Put the beef, bones and all, with the water in a
close vessel, and set it where it will heat gradually. Let
it boil very slowly for six hours at least, only uncovering
the pot once in a great while to see if there is danger of
the water sinking too rapidly. Should this be the case,
replenish with boiling water, taking care not to put in too
much. During the seventh hour, take off the soup and set
it away in a cool place, until next morning. About an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hour before dinner, take out the meat, which you can use
for mince-meat, if you wish; remove the cake of fat from
the surface of the stock, set the soup over the fire, and
throw in a little salt to bring up the scum. When this
has been skimmed carefully off, put in your vegetables.
These should be:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>3 turnips.</li>
<li>Half a head of white cabbage.</li>
<li>1 pt. green corn—or dried Shaker corn, soaked over night.</li>
<li>1 head celery.</li>
<li>1 qt. tomatoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be prepared for the soup by slicing them
very small, and stewing them in barely enough water to
cover them, until they break to pieces. Cook the cabbage
by itself in two waters—throwing the first away. The
only exception to the general dissolution, is in the case of
a single carrot, which should likewise be cooked alone and
whole, until thoroughly done, and set aside to cool, when
the rest of the vegetables, with the water in which they
were boiled, are added to the soup. Return the pot to
the fire with the vegetables and stock, and boil slowly for
half an hour from the time ebullition actually begins.
Strain without pressing, only shaking and lightly stirring
the contents of the cullender. The vegetables having been
added with all their juices already cooked, much boiling
and squeezing are not needed, and only make the soup
cloudy. Cut the reserved carrot into dice and drop into
the clear liquor after it is in the tureen,—also, if you like,
a handful of vermicelli, or macaroni which has been boiled
tender in clear water.</p>

<p>The seasoning of this excellent soup is a matter of taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Some use only salt and white pepper. Others like with
this a few blades of mace, and boil in the stock a handful
of sweet herbs. And others fancy that, in addition to
these, a glass of brown sherry imparts a flavor that renders
it peculiarly acceptable to most palates. Send to table
very hot, and have the soup-plates likewise heated.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Soup with Macaroni.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. of veal knuckle or scrag, with the bones broken and meat cut up.</li>
<li>3 qts. water.</li>
<li>¼ lb. Italian macaroni.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the meat alone in the water for nearly three hours
until it is reduced to shreds; and the macaroni until tender,
in enough water to cover it, in a vessel by itself. The
pieces should not be more than an inch in length. Add a
little butter to the macaroni when nearly done. Strain
the meat out of the soup, season to your taste, put in the
macaroni, and the water in which it was boiled; let it
boil up, and serve.</p>

<p>You can make macaroni soup of this by boiling a pound,
instead of a quarter of a pound, in the second vessel, and
adding the above quantity of veal broth. In this case,
send on with it a plate of grated cheese, that those who
cannot relish macaroni without this accompaniment may
put it into their soup. Take care that the macaroni is of
uniform length, not too long, and that it does not break
while stewing. Add butter in proportion to the increased
quantity of macaroni.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Soup</span> (<i>brown</i>).</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. beef cut into strips.</li>
<li>3 onions.</li>
<li>3 qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put beef and water into the saucepan and boil for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hour. Meanwhile, slice the onions and fry them in butter
to a light brown. Drop into the pot with a teaspoonful
of cloves, half as much pepper, same quantity of mace as
pepper, a pinch of allspice, and a teaspoonful of essence
of celery, if you cannot get a head of fresh celery; also
half a teaspoonful of powdered savory or sweet marjoram,
and a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Stew all for
two hours more, or until the beef has boiled to pieces.
Strain the soup and return to the fire. Salt to taste, and
just before taking it off, pour in a glass of brown sherry
or Madeira wine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton or Lamb Broth.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 lbs. mutton or lamb—<i>lean</i>—cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>½ teacupful rice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the unsalted meat for two hours, slowly, in a covered
vessel. Soak the rice in enough warm water to cover
it, and at the end of this time add it, water and all, to
the boiling soup. Cook an hour longer, stirring watchfully
from time to time, lest the rice should settle and adhere
to the bottom of the pot. Beat an egg to a froth
and stir into a cup of cold milk, into which has been
rubbed smoothly a tablespoonful rice or wheat flour.
Mix with this, a little at a time, some of the scalding
liquor, until the egg is so far cooked that there is no danger
of curdling in the soup. Pour into the pot, when you
have taken out the meat, season with parsley, thyme, pepper,
and salt. Boil up fairly, and serve. If allowed to
stand on the fire, it is apt to burn.</p>

<p>This soup may be made from the liquor in which a leg
of mutton has been boiled, provided too much salt was
not put in with it. It is especially good when the stock
is chicken broth. For the sick it is palatable and nutritious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with the rice left in. When strained it makes a nice
white table soup, and is usually relished by all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 lbs. lamb, from which every particle of fat has been removed.</li>
<li>1 lb. veal.</li>
<li>A slice of corned ham.</li>
<li>5 qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut up the meat, cover it with a quart of water, and set
it back on the range to heat very gradually, keeping it
covered closely. At the end of an hour, add four quarts
of boiling water, and cook until the meat is in shreds.
Season with salt, sweet herbs, a chopped shallot, two teaspoonfuls
Worcestershire sauce, and when these have
boiled in the soup for ten minutes, strain and return to
the fire. Have ready about a third of a pound of vermicelli
(or macaroni), which has been boiled tender in clear
water. Add this; boil up once, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock-Turtle or Calf’s Head Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 large calf’s head, well cleaned and washed.</li>
<li>4 pig’s feet, well cleaned and washed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This soup should always be prepared the day before it
is to be served up. Lay the head and feet in the bottom
of a large pot, and cover with a gallon of water. Let it
boil three hours, or until the flesh will slip easily from the
bones. Take out the head, leaving in the feet, and allow
these to boil steadily while you cut the meat from the
head. Select with care enough of the fatty portions which
lie on the top of the head and the cheeks to fill a teacup,
and set them aside to cool. Remove the brains to a saucer
and also set aside. Chop the rest of the meat with the
tongue very fine, season with salt, pepper, powdered marjoram
and thyme, a teaspoonful of cloves, the same of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mace, half as much allspice, and a grated nutmeg, and
return to the pot. When the flesh falls from the bones of
the pig’s feet, take out the latter, leaving in the gelatinous
meat. Let all boil together slowly, without removing the
cover, for two hours more; take the soup from the fire
and set it away until the next day. An hour before dinner,
set on the stock to warm. When it boils strain carefully,
and drop in the meat you have reserved, which,
when cold, should be cut into small squares. Have these
all ready as well as the force-meat balls. To prepare
these, rub the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs to a paste in a
Wedgewood mortar, or in a bowl, with the back of a silver
tablespoon, adding gradually the brains to moisten them,
also a little butter and salt. Mix with these two eggs
beaten very light, flour your hands, and make this paste
into balls about the size of a pigeon’s egg. Throw them
into the soup five minutes before you take it from the fire;
stir in three large tablespoonfuls of browned flour rubbed
smooth in three great spoonfuls of melted butter, let it boil
up well, and finish the seasoning by the addition of a glass
and a half of <i>good</i> wine—Sherry or Madeira—and the juice
of a lemon. It should not boil more than half an hour on
the second day. Serve with sliced lemon. Some lay the
slices upon the top of the soup, but the better plan is to
pass to the guests a small dish containing these.</p>

<p>If the directions be closely followed, the result is sure
to be satisfactory, and the task is really much less troublesome
than it appears to be.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Feet, neck, pinions, and giblets of three chickens, or of two ducks or two geese.</li>
<li>1½ lb. veal.</li>
<li>½ lb. ham.</li>
<li>3 qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Crack the bones into small pieces, and cut the meat into
strips. Put all together with the giblets over the fire,
with a bunch of sweet herbs and a pinch of allspice.
Stew slowly for two hours. Take out the giblets and set
them aside in a pan where they will keep warm. Take
up a teacupful of the hot soup and stir into this a large
tablespoonful of flour which has been wet with cold water
and rubbed to a smooth paste; then, two tablespoonfuls of
butter. Return to the pot and boil for fifteen minutes;
season at the last with a glass of brown sherry and a tablespoonful
of tomato or walnut catsup. A little Worcestershire
sauce is an improvement. Finally, chop and add
the giblets, and boil up once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Gravy Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. beef.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>1 head of celery.</li>
<li>6 onions, if small button onions—one, if large.</li>
<li>3½ qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have ready some nice dripping in a frying-pan. Slice
the onions and fry them brown. Take them out and set
them by in a covered pan to keep warm. Cut the beef into
bits an inch long and half an inch thick, and fry them brown
also, turning frequently lest they should burn. Chop the
vegetables and put them with the meat and onions into a
covered pot. Pour on the water and let all stew together
for two hours. Then throw in salt and pepper and boil one
hour longer, skimming very carefully. Strain; put back
over the fire; boil up once more to make the liquid perfectly
clear, skim, and add a handful of vermicelli that has
been boiled separately and drained dry. The safest plan is
to put in the vermicelli after the soup is poured into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tureen. Do not stir before it goes to table. The contents
of the tureen should be clear as amber. Some add half a
glass of <i>pale</i> Sherry. This is a fine show soup, and very
popular.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2½ lbs. veal chopped fine.</li>
<li>¼ lb. pearl sago.</li>
<li>1 pt. milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>3 qts. water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the veal and water, and boil slowly until the
liquid is reduced to about one-half the original quantity.
Strain out the shreds of meat, and put the soup again over
the fire. Meanwhile the sago should be washed in several
waters, and soaked half an hour in warm water enough to
cover it. Stir it into the strained broth and boil—stirring
very often to prevent lumping or scorching—half an hour
more. Heat the milk almost to boiling; beat the yolks of
the eggs very light; mix with the milk gradually, as in
making boiled custard, and pour—stirring all the while—into
the soup. Season with pepper and salt; boil up once
to cook the eggs, and serve. Should the liquid be too thick
after putting in the eggs, replenish with boiling water. It
should be about the consistency of hot custard.</p>

<p>This soup is very good, if chicken broth be substituted
for the veal. It is very strengthening to invalids, and
especially beneficial to those suffering from colds and
pulmonary affections.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 young fowls, or one full-grown.</li>
<li>½ lb. corned ham.</li>
<li>1 gallon of water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Cut the fowls into pieces as for fricassee. Put these
with the ham into the pot with a quart of water, or enough
to cover them fairly. Stew for an hour, if the fowls are
tender; if tough, until you can cut easily into the breast.
Take out the breasts, leaving the rest of the meat in the
pot, and add the remainder of the water—boiling hot.
Keep the soup stewing slowly while you chop up the
white meat you have selected. Rub the yolks of four
hard-boiled eggs smooth in a mortar or bowl, moistening
to a paste with a few spoonfuls of the soup. Mix with these
a handful of fine bread-crumbs and the chopped meat,
and make it into small balls. When the soup has boiled
in all, two hours and a half, if the chicken be reduced to
shreds, strain out the meat and bones. Season with salt
and white pepper, with a bunch of chopped parsley. Drop
in the prepared force-meat, and after boiling ten minutes
to incorporate the ingredients well, add, a little at a time,
a pint of rich milk thickened with flour. Boil up once
and serve.</p>

<p>A chicken at least a year old would make better soup
than a younger fowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lbs. of venison. What are considered the inferior pieces will do.</li>
<li>1 lb. corned ham or salt pork.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 head of celery.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut up the meat; chop the vegetables, and put on with
just enough water to cover them, keeping on the lid of
the pot all the while, and stew slowly for one hour. Then
add two quarts of boiling water, with a few blades of
mace and a dozen whole peppers. Or, should you prefer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a little cayenne. Boil two hours longer, salt, and strain.
Return the liquor to the pot; stir in a tablespoonful of
butter, thicken with a tablespoonful of browned flour wet
into a smooth thin paste with cold water; add a tablespoonful
of walnut or mushroom catsup, a teaspoonful of
Worcestershire or other pungent sauce, and a generous
glass of Madeira or brown Sherry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hare or Rabbit Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Dissect the rabbit, crack the bones, and prepare precisely
as you would the venison soup, only putting in three
small onions instead of one, and a bunch of sweet herbs.
Hares which are too tough to be cooked in any other way,
make excellent game soup. Also, the large gray squirrel
of the Middle and Southern States.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-Tail Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 ox-tail.</li>
<li>2 lbs. lean beef.</li>
<li>4 carrots.</li>
<li>3 onions.</li>
<li>Thyme.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the tail into several pieces and fry brown in butter.
Slice the onions and two carrots, and when you
remove the ox-tail from the frying-pan, put in these and
brown them also. When done, tie them in a bag with a
bunch of thyme and drop into the soup-pot. Lay the
pieces of ox-tail in the same; then the meat cut into small
slices. Grate over them the two whole carrots, and add
four quarts of cold water, with pepper and salt. Boil
from four to six hours, in proportion to the size of the
tail. Strain fifteen minutes before serving it, and thicken
with two tablespoonfuls of browned flour. Boil ten
minutes longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3>FISH SOUPS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup</span> (No. 1). ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 qts. of oysters.</li>
<li>1 qt. of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strain the liquor from the oysters, add to it the water,
and set it over the fire to heat slowly in a covered vessel.
When it is near boiling, season with pepper and salt; add
the oysters, and let them stew until they “ruffle” on the
edge. This will be in about five minutes. Then put in the
butter with the milk which has been heated in a separate
vessel, and stir well for two minutes.</p>

<p>Serve with sliced lemon and oyster or cream crackers.
Some use mace and nutmeg in seasoning. The crowning
excellence in oyster soup is to have it cooked just enough.
Too much stewing ruins the bivalves, while an underdone
oyster is a flabby abomination. The plumpness of the
main body and ruffled edge are good indices of their right
condition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup</span> (No. 2).</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 qts. of oysters.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 qt. of milk.</li>
<li>1 teacupful of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strain the liquor from the oysters into a saucepan, pour
in with it the water. Season with cayenne pepper and
a little salt, a teaspoonful of mingled nutmeg, mace, and
cloves. When the liquor is almost boiling, add half the
oysters chopped finely and boil five minutes quite briskly.
Strain the soup and return to saucepan. Have ready some
force-meat balls, not larger than marbles, made of the
yolks of the eggs boiled hard and rubbed to a smooth paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with a little butter, then mix with six raw oysters chopped
very finely, a little salt, and a raw egg well beaten,
to bind the ingredients together. Flour your hands well
and roll the force-meat into pellets, laying them upon a
cold plate, so as not to touch one another until needed.
Then put the reserved whole oysters into the hot soup, and
when it begins to boil again, drop in the force-meat marbles.
Boil until the oysters “ruffle,” by which time the
balls will also be done. Add the hot milk.</p>

<p>Serve with sliced lemon and crackers. A liberal tablespoonful
of butter stirred in gently at the last is an improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>50 clams.</li>
<li>1 qt. milk.</li>
<li>1 pint water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain off the liquor from the clams and put it over the
fire with a dozen whole peppers, a few bits of cayenne
pods, half a dozen blades of mace, and salt to taste. Let
it boil for ten minutes, then put in the clams and boil half
an hour quite fast, keeping the pot closely covered. If
you dislike to see the whole spices in the tureen, strain
them out before the clams are added. At the end of the
half hour add the milk, which has been heated to scalding,
not boiling, in another vessel. Boil up again, taking
care the soup does not burn, and put in the butter. Then
serve without delay. If you desire a thicker soup stir a
heaping tablespoonful of rice-flour into a little cold milk,
and put in with the quart of hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cat-fish Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Those who have only seen the bloated, unsightly “hornpouts”
that play the scavengers about city wharves, are
excusable for entertaining a prejudice against them as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
article of food. But the small cat-fish of our inland lakes
and streams are altogether respectable, except in their
unfortunate name.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 cat-fish, in average weight half a pound apiece.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork.</li>
<li>1 pint milk.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 head of celery, or a small bag of celery seed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skin and clean the fish and cut them up. Chop the
pork into small pieces. Put these together into the pot,
with two quarts of water, chopped sweet herbs, and the
celery seasoning. Boil for an hour, or until fish and pork
are in rags, and strain, if you desire a regular soup for a
first course. Return to the saucepan and add the milk,
which should be already hot. Next the eggs, beaten to a
froth, and a lump of butter the size of a walnut. Boil up
once, and serve with dice of toasted bread on the top.
Pass sliced lemon, or walnut or butternut pickles with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eel Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Eel soup is made in precisely the same manner as cat-fish,
only boiled longer. A chopped onion is no detriment
to the flavor of either, and will remove the muddy taste
which these fish sometimes acquire from turbid streams.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 qts. veal or chicken broth, well strained.</li>
<li>1 large lobster.</li>
<li>2 eggs—boiled hard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the lobster and extract the meat, setting aside the
coral in a cool place. Cut or chop up the meat found in
the claws. Rub the yolks of the eggs to a paste with a
teaspoonful of butter. Pound and rub the claw-meat in
the same manner, and mix with the yolks. Beat up a raw
egg, and stir into the paste; season with pepper, salt, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
if you like, mace; make into force-meat balls, and set away
with the coral to cool and harden. By this time the stock
should be well heated, when, put in the rest of the lobster-meat
cut into square bits. Boil fifteen minutes, which time
employ in pounding the coral in a Wedgewood mortar, or
earthenware bowl, rubbing it into a fine, even paste, with
the addition of a few spoonfuls of the broth, gradually
worked in until it is about the consistency of boiled starch.
Stir <i>very</i> carefully into the hot soup, which should, in the
process, blush into a roseate hue. Lastly, drop in the
force-meat balls, after which do not stir, lest they should
break. Simmer a few minutes to cook the raw egg; but,
if allowed to boil, the soup will darken.</p>

<p>Crab soup may be made in the same way, excepting the
coralline process, crabs being destitute of that dainty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>A glass of Madeira.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon.</li>
<li>5 qts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop up the coarser parts of the turtle-meat, with the
entrails and bones. Add to them four quarts of water,
and stew four hours with the herbs, onions, pepper, and
salt. Stew very slowly, but do not let it cease to boil during
this time. At the end of four hours strain the soup,
and add the finer parts of the turtle and the green fat,
which has been simmered for one hour in two quarts of
water. Thicken with browned flour; return to the soup-pot,
and simmer gently an hour longer. If there are eggs
in the turtle, boil them in a separate vessel for four hours,
and throw into the soup before taking it up. If not, put
in force-meat balls; then the juice of the lemon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wine; beat up once and pour out. Some cooks add the
finer meat before straining, boiling all together five hours;
then strain, thicken, and put in the green fat, cut into
lumps an inch long. This makes a handsomer soup than
if the meat is left in.</p>

<p>For the mock eggs, take the yolks of three hard-boiled
eggs, and one raw egg well beaten. Rub the boiled eggs
into a paste with a teaspoonful of butter, bind with the
raw egg, roll into pellets the size and shape of turtle-eggs,
and lay in boiling water for two minutes before dropping
into the soup.</p>

<h4><i>Force-meat balls for the above.</i></h4>

<p>Six tablespoonfuls turtle-meat chopped very fine. Rub
to a paste with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs; tablespoonful
of butter, and, if convenient, a little oyster-liquor.
Season with cayenne, mace, and half a teaspoonful
of white sugar. Bind with a well-beaten egg; shape
into balls; dip in egg, then powdered cracker, fry in butter,
and drop into the soup when it is served.</p>

<p>Green turtle for soups is now within the reach of every
private family, being well preserved in air-tight cans.</p>



<h3>FISH.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Codfish.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Lay the fish in cold water, slightly salted, for half an
hour before it is time to cook it. When it has been wiped
free of the salt and water, wrap it in a clean linen cloth
kept for such purposes. The cloth should be dredged with
flour, to prevent sticking. Sew up the edges in such a
manner as to envelop the fish entirely, yet have but one
thickness of the cloth over any part. The wrapping
should be fitted neatly to the shape of the piece to be
cooked. Put into the fish-kettle, pour on plenty of hot
water, and boil briskly—fifteen minutes for each pound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Have ready a sauce prepared thus:—</p>

<p>To one gill boiling water add as much milk, and when
it is scalding-hot, stir in—leaving the sauce-pan on the
fire—two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled thickly in flour;
as this thickens, two beaten eggs. Season with salt and
chopped parsley, and when, after one good boil, you withdraw
it from the fire, add a dozen capers, or pickled nasturtium
seeds, or, if you prefer, a spoonful of vinegar in
which celery-seeds have been steeped. Put the fish into a
hot dish, and pour the sauce over it. Some serve in a
butter-boat; but I fancy that the boiling sauce applied to
the steaming fish imparts a richness it cannot gain later.
Garnish with sprigs of parsley and circles of hard-boiled
eggs, laid around the edge of the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rock-Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Rock-fish and river-bass are very nice, cooked as above,
but do not need to be boiled so long as codfish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Codfish.</span> (<i>Salt.</i>)</h3>

<p>Put the fish to soak over night in lukewarm water—as
early as eight o’clock in the evening. Change this for
more warm water at bed-time and cover closely. Change
again in the morning and wash off the salt. Two hours
before dinner plunge into <i>very</i> cold water. This makes it
firm. Finally, set over the fire with enough lukewarm
water to cover it, and boil for half an hour. Drain well;
lay it on a hot dish, and pour over it egg-sauce prepared
as in the foregoing receipt, only substituting the yolks of
two hard-boiled eggs, rubbed to a paste with butter, for
the beaten raw egg.</p>

<p>This is a useful receipt for country housekeepers who can
seldom procure fresh cod. Salt mackerel, prepared in the
same way, will repay the care and time required, so superior
is it to the Friday’s dish of salt fish, as usually served.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Should the cold fish left over be used for fish-balls—as
it should be—it will be found that the sauce which has
soaked into it while hot has greatly improved it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Codfish Balls.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Prepare the fish precisely as for boiling whole. Cut in
pieces when it has been duly washed and soaked, and boil
twenty minutes. Turn off the water, and cover with fresh
from the boiling tea-kettle. Boil twenty minutes more,
drain the fish very dry, and spread upon a dish to cool.
When perfectly cold, pick to pieces with a fork, removing
every vestige of skin and bone, and shredding very fine.
When this is done, add an equal bulk of mashed potato;
work into a stiff batter by adding a lump of butter and
sweet milk, and if you want to have them very nice, a
beaten egg. Flour your hands and make the mixture
into balls or cakes. Drop them into boiling lard or good
dripping, and fry to a light brown. Plainer fish-cakes
may be made of the cod and potatoes alone, moulded
round like biscuit. In any shape the dish is popular.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salt Codfish stewed with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the fish as for balls. Heat almost to boiling
a pint of rich, sweet milk, and stir into it, gradually and
carefully, three eggs, well beaten, a tablespoonful of butter,
a little chopped parsley and butter, with pepper, lastly the
fish. Boil up once and turn into a deep covered dish, or
chafing dish lined with buttered toast. Eat hot for breakfast
or supper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Codfish and Potato Stew.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Soak, boil, and pick the fish, if salt, as for fish-balls. If
fresh, boil and pick into bits. Add an equal quantity of
mashed potatoes, a large tablespoonful of butter and
milk, enough to make it very soft. Put into a skillet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and add a little boiling water to keep it from burning.
Turn and toss constantly until it is smoking hot but
not dry; add pepper and parsley, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mackerel.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean the mackerel and wipe carefully with a dry,
clean cloth; wash them lightly with another cloth dipped
in vinegar; wrap each in a coarse linen cloth (floured)
basted closely to the shape of the fish. Put them into a
pot with enough salted water to cover them, and boil
them gently for three quarters of an hour. Drain them well.
Take a teacupful of the water in which they were boiled,
and put into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of walnut catsup,
some anchovy paste or sauce, and the juice of half a
lemon. Let this boil up well and add a lump of butter the
size of an egg, with a tablespoonful browned flour wet in
cold water. Boil up again and serve in the sauce-boat. This
makes a brown sauce. You can substitute egg-sauce if
you like. Garnish with parsley and nasturtium blossoms.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Mackerel.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>)</h3>

<p>Clean the mackerel, wash, and wipe dry. Split it open,
so that when laid flat the backbone will be in the middle.
Sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay on a buttered gridiron
over a clear fire, with the inside downward, until it begins
to brown; then turn the other. When quite done, lay on
a hot dish and butter it plentifully. Turn another hot
dish over the lower one, and let it stand two or three
minutes before sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Mackerel.</span> (<i>Salt.</i>)</h3>

<p>Soak over night in lukewarm water. Change this early
in the morning for very cold, and let the fish lie in this
until time to cook. Then proceed as with the fresh
mackerel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Halibut.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Lay in cold salt and water for an hour. Wipe dry and
score the skin in squares. Put into the kettle with cold
salted water enough to cover it. It is so firm in texture
that you can boil without a cloth if you choose. Let it
heat gradually, and boil from half to three-quarters of
an hour, in proportion to the size of the piece. Four or
five pounds will be enough for most private families.
Drain and accompany by egg-sauce—either poured over
the fish, or in a sauce-boat.</p>

<p>Save the cold remnants of the fish and what sauce is left
until next morning. Pick out as you would cod, mix with
an equal quantity of mashed potato, moisten with the
sauce, or with milk and butter if you have no sauce, put
it into a skillet, and stir until it is very hot. Do not
burn. Season with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Halibut.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Take a piece of halibut weighing five or six pounds,
and lay in salt and water for two hours. Wipe dry and
score the outer skin. Set in the baking-pan in a tolerably
hot oven, and bake an hour, basting often with butter
and water heated together in a saucepan or tin cup. When
a fork will penetrate it easily it is done. It should be of
a fine brown. Take the gravy in the dripping-pan—add a
little boiling water should there not be enough—stir in a
tablespoonful of walnut catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce, the juice of a lemon, and thicken with
browned flour, previously wet with cold water. Boil up
once and put into sauce-boat.</p>

<p>There is no finer preparation of halibut than this, which
is, however, comparatively little known. Those who have
eaten it usually prefer it to boiled and broiled. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
use what is left for the same purpose as the fragments of
boiled halibut.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Halibut Steak.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Wash and wipe the steaks dry. Beat up two or three
eggs, and roll out some Boston or other brittle crackers
upon the kneading-board until they are fine as dust. Dip
each steak into the beaten egg, then into the bread crumbs
(when you have salted the fish), and fry in hot fat, lard,
or nice dripping.</p>

<p>Or, you can broil the steak upon a buttered gridiron,
over a clear fire, first seasoning with salt and pepper.
When done, lay in a hot dish, butter well, and cover
closely.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Halibut.</span></h3>

<p>Mince a pound of cold boiled or baked halibut, or the
fragments of halibut steak, and make for it the following
dressing: The yolks of three hard-boiled eggs rubbed
smooth with the back of a silver spoon, or in a Wedgewood
mortar, and when there remain no lumps in it, work into
a soft paste with a tablespoonful salad oil. Next beat in
two teaspoonfuls white sugar, a teaspoonful made mustard,
a pinch of cayenne, teaspoonful salt, one of Worcestershire
sauce, a little anchovy paste if you have it, and finally, a
little at a time to prevent lumping, a <i>small</i> teacupful of
vinegar in which celery-seed have been steeped. It is easy
to keep a bottle of this on hand for salads and sauces.
Stir all thoroughly into the minced fish, garnish with a
chain of the whites of the eggs cut into rings, with a small
round slice of pickled beet laid within each link, and you
have a <i>piquant</i> and pretty salad for the supper-table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Salmon.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Wrap the fish, when you have washed and wiped it, in
a clean linen cloth—not too thick—baste it up securely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and put into the fish-kettle. Cover with cold water in
which has been melted a handful of salt. Boil slowly,
allowing about a quarter of an hour to each pound. When
the time is up, rip open a corner of the cloth and test the
salmon with a fork. If it penetrate easily, it is done. If
not, hastily pin up the cloth and cook a little longer.
Skim off the scum as it rises to the top. Have ready in
another saucepan a pint of cream—or half milk and half
cream will do—which has been heated in a vessel set in
boiling water; stir into this a large spoonful of butter,
rolled in flour, a little salt and chopped parsley, and a
half-gill of the water in which the fish is boiled. Let it
boil up once, stirring all the while. When the fish is done,
take it instantly from the kettle, lay it an instant upon a
folded cloth to absorb the drippings; transfer with great
care, for fear of breaking, to a hot dish, and pour the
boiled cream over it, reserving enough to fill a small sauce-boat.
Garnish with curled parsley and circular slices of
hard-boiled yolks—leaving out the whites of the eggs.</p>

<p>After serving boiled salmon with cream-sauce, you will
never be quite content with any other. If you cannot get
cream, boil a pint of milk and thicken with arrow-root.
It is not so nice, but many will not detect the difference—<i>real</i>
cream being a rare commodity in town.</p>

<p>You may pickle what is left, if it is in one piece. Or
devil it, as I have directed you to treat cold halibut. <i>Or</i>
mince, mixed with mashed potato, milk, and butter, and
stir into a sort of stew. Or, once again, mix with mashed
potato, milk, butter, and a raw egg well-beaten; make
into cakes or balls, and fry in hot lard or dripping. At
any rate, let none of it be lost, it being at once one of our
most expensive and most delicious fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Salmon.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Wash and wipe dry, and rub with pepper and salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Some add a soupçon of cayenne and powdered mace. Lay
the fish upon a grating set over your baking-pan, and
roast or bake, basting it freely with butter, and, toward
the last, with its own drippings only. Should it brown
too fast, cover the top with a sheet of white paper until
the whole is cooked. When it is done, transfer to a hot
dish and cover closely, and add to the gravy a little hot
water thickened with arrow-root, rice, or wheat flour,—wet,
of course, first with cold water,—a great spoonful of
strained tomato sauce, and the juice of a lemon. Boil up
and serve in a sauce boat, or you can serve with cream
sauce, made as for boiled salmon. Garnish handsomely
with alternate sprigs of parsley and the bleached tops of
celery, with ruby bits of firm currant jelly here and there.
This is a fine dish for a dinner-party. A glass of Sherry
improves the first-named sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Steaks.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Dry well with a cloth, dredge with flour, and lay them
upon a well-buttered gridiron, over clear hot coals. Turn
with a broad-bladed knife slipped beneath, and a flat wire
egg-beater above, lest the steak should break. When
done to a light brown, lay in a hot dish, butter each steak,
seasoning with salt and pepper, cover closely, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Salmon.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Having cleaned your fish, cut into pieces of a convenient
size to go into the fish-kettle, and boil in salted water
as for the table. Drain it very dry, wipe it with a clean
cloth, and set it aside in a cool place until next morning.</p>

<p>Make pickle enough to cover it in the following proportions:
2 quarts vinegar, a dozen blades of mace, dozen
white peppers, dozen cloves, two teaspoonfuls made mustard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
three tablespoonfuls white sugar, and a pint of the
water in which the fish was boiled. Let them boil up
once hard, that you may skim the pickle. Should the
spices come away with the scum in large quantities, pick
them out and return to the kettle. Set the liquor away
in an earthenware jar, closely covered, to keep in the flavor.
Next morning hang it over a brisk fire in a bell-metal
kettle (covered), and heat to boiling. Meanwhile,
prepare the salmon by cutting into pieces an inch and a
half long and half an inch wide. Cut cleanly and regularly
with a sharp knife. When they are all ready, and
the liquor is on the boil, drop them carefully into the kettle.
Let the pickle boil up once to make sure the salmon
is heated through. Have ready some air-tight glass jars,
such as you use for canning fruit and tomatoes. Take the
salmon from the kettle, while it is still on the stove or
range, with a wire-egg-beater, taking care you do not
break the pieces. Drop them rapidly into the jar, packing
closely as you go on; fill with the boiling pickle
until it overflows, screw on the top, and set away in a dark,
cool place. Proceed in the same way with each can until
all are full. Salmon thus put up will keep good for <i>years</i>,
as I can testify from experience, and will well repay the
trouble of preparation. You can vary the seasoning to
your taste, adding a shallot or two minced very fine, some
celery and small pods of cayenne pepper, which always
<i>look</i> well in vinegar.</p>

<p>Be sure that the contents of the kettle are boiling when
transferred to the cans, that they are not allowed time to
cool in the transit, that the elastic on the can is properly
adjusted, and the top screwed down tightly, and success is
certain. I would call the attention of those who are fond
of the potted spiced salmon, sold at a high price in grocery
stores, to this receipt for making the same luxury at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
It costs less by one-half, is as good, and is always on
hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Salmon.</span> (<i>Salt.</i>)</h3>

<p>Wash the salmon in two or three waters, rubbing it
lightly with a coarse cloth to remove the salt-crystals. Then
soak over night in tepid water. Exchange this in the morning
for ice-cold, and let the fish lie in the latter for three
hours. Take it out, wipe dry, and cut in strips as directed
in the foregoing receipt. Drop these, when all are ready,
in a saucepan of boiling water, placed alongside of a kettle
of pickle prepared as for fresh salmon. Beside these have
your air-tight jars, covers laid in readiness, and when the
salmon has boiled five minutes—fairly boiled, not simmered—fish
out the pieces with your wire spoon, pack rapidly
into your can; fill up with the boiling pickle from the
other kettle, and seal instantly. In two days the pickled
salmon will be fit for use, and is scarcely distinguishable
from that made of fresh fish. It has the advantage of
being always procurable, and of comparative cheapness,
and in the country is a valuable stand-by in case of unexpected
supper company.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smoked Salmon.</span> (<i>Broiled.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take a piece of raw smoked salmon the size of your
hand, or larger in proportion to the number who are to sit
down to supper. Wash it in two waters, rubbing off the
salt. Lay in a skillet with enough warm—not hot—water
to cover it; let it simmer fifteen minutes, and boil five.
Remove it, wipe dry, and lay on a buttered gridiron to
broil. When it is nicely browned on both sides, transfer
to a hot dish; butter liberally, and pepper to taste.
Garnish with hillocks of grated horse-radish interspersed
with sprays of fresh or pickled fennel-seed, or with parsley.</p>

<p>Raw smoked salmon is in common use upon the supper-table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cut into smooth strips as long as the middle finger,
and rather wider; arranged neatly upon a garnished dish,
and eaten with pepper-sauce or some other pungent condiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Shad.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe the fish. A roe shad is best for
this purpose. Cleanse the roes thoroughly, and having
sprinkled both shad and eggs with salt, wrap in separate
cloths and put into a fish-kettle, side by side. Cover with
salted water, and boil from half an hour to three-quarters,
in proportion to the size. Experience is the best rule as
to the time. When you have once cooked fish to a turn,
note the weight and time, and you will be at no loss thereafter.
A good rule is to make a pencilled memorandum
in the margin of the receipt-book opposite certain receipts.</p>

<p>Serve the shad upon a hot dish, with a boat of drawn
butter mingled with chopped eggs and parsley, or egg-sauce.
Lay the roes about the body of the fish. Garnish with
capers and slices of hard boiled eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Shad.</span> (<i>Salt.</i>)</h3>

<p>Soak the fish six or seven hours in warm water, changing
it several times; wipe off all the salt and immerse in
ice-cold water. When it has lain in this an hour, put into
a fish-kettle with enough fresh water to cover it, and boil
from fifteen to twenty minutes, in proportion to the size.
Serve in a hot dish, with a large lump of butter spread
over the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Shad.</span> (<i>Fresh.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Wash, wipe, and split the fish. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper, and lay it upon a buttered gridiron, inside downward.
When the lower side is browned, turn the fish.
One of medium size will be done in about twenty minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Serve upon a hot dish, and lay a good piece of butter upon
the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Shad.</span> (<i>Salt.</i>)</h3>

<p>Soak over night in lukewarm water. Take out in the
morning and transfer to ice-cold for half an hour. Wipe
very dry, and broil as you do fresh shad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Shad.</span></h3>

<p>This is a popular dish upon Southern tables, and is good
anywhere. Clean, wash, and wipe a fine roe-shad; split
and cut each side into four pieces, leaving out the head,
and removing fins and tail. Sprinkle with salt and pepper,
and dredge with flour. Have ready a frying pan of
boiling hot lard or drippings; put in the fish and fry
brown, turning at the end of five minutes to cook the other
side. Fry the roe in the same way; lay the fish in the
middle of the dish, and the roe outside of it; garnish
with water-cresses and sprigs of pickled cauliflower, and
eat with catsup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Shad.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe the fish, which should be a large
one. Make a stuffing of grated bread-crumbs, butter,
salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. Stuff the shad and sew it
up. Lay it in the baking-pan, with a cupful of water to
keep it from burning, and bake an hour, basting with butter
and water, until it is tender throughout and well
browned. Take it up, put in a hot dish and cover tightly,
while you boil up the gravy with a great spoonful of catsup,
a tablespoonful of browned flour which has been wet
with cold water, the juice of a lemon, and, if you want to
have it very fine, a glass of Sherry or Madeira. Garnish
with sliced lemon and water-cresses. You may pour the
gravy around the fish, or serve in a sauce-boat. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
course you take out the thread with which it has been
sewed up before serving the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Sea-Bass.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and put the fish into the fish-kettle, with salted
water enough to cover it when you have enveloped it in
the fish-cloth. A medium-sized fish will be done in a little
over half an hour. But do not boil too fast. When
done, drain and serve in a hot dish. Lay sliced boiled
eggs upon and about it, and serve with egg-sauce, mingled
with capers and nasturtium seed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Sea-Bass.</span></h3>

<p>Use smaller fish for this purpose than for boiling.
Clean, wipe dry, inside and out, dredge with flour and
season with salt. Fry in hot butter or dripping. A mixture,
half butter, half lard, is good for frying fish. The
bass should be done to a delicate brown—not to a crisp.
The fashion affected by some cooks of drying fried fish to
a crust is simply abominable.</p>

<p>Fried bass are a most acceptable breakfast dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sturgeon Steak.</span></h3>

<p>Skin the steaks carefully and lay in salted water (cold)
for an hour, to remove the oily taste, so offensive to most
palates. Then wipe each steak dry, salt, and broil over
hot coals on a buttered gridiron. Serve in a hot dish
when you have buttered and peppered them, and send up
garnished with parsley and accompanied by a small glass
dish containing sliced lemon.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can pour over them a sauce prepared in this way:—</p>

<p>Put a tablespoonful of butter into a frying-pan, and stir
until it is brown—<i>not</i> burned. Add a half-teacupful of
boiling water in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
browned flour previously wet with cold water. Add salt,
a teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce or anchovy, the juice
of a lemon, and let it boil up well. Pour over the steaks
when you have arranged them in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sturgeon.</span></h3>

<p>A piece of sturgeon weighing five or six pounds is
enough for a handsome dish. Skin it and let it stand in
salt and water for half an hour. Parboil it to remove the
oil. Make a dressing of bread-crumbs, minute bits of fat
salt pork, sweet herbs, and butter. Gash the upper part
of the fish quite deeply, and rub this force-meat well in;
put in a baking-pan with a little water to keep it from
burning, and bake for an hour.</p>

<p>Serve with a sauce of drawn butter, in which has been
stirred a spoonful of caper sauce and another of catsup.</p>

<p>This is a Virginia receipt, and an admirable one.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mayonnaise.</span> (<i>Fish.</i>)</h3>

<p>Take a pound or so of cold boiled fish (halibut, rock, or
cod), cut—not chop—into pieces an inch in length. Mix
in a bowl a dressing as follows: the yolks of four boiled
eggs rubbed to a smooth paste with salad oil; add to these
salt, pepper, mustard, two teaspoonfuls white sugar, and,
lastly, six tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Beat the mixture
until light, and just before pouring it over the fish, stir
in lightly the frothed white of a raw egg. Serve the fish
in a glass dish, with half the dressing stirred in with it.
Spread the remainder over the top, and lay blanched
lettuce-leaves around the edges, to be eaten with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Salmon-Trout.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Those who have eaten this prince of game fish in the
Adirondacks, within an hour after he has left the lake,
will agree with me that he never has such justice done him
at any other time as when baked with cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Handle the beauty with gentle respect while cleaning,
washing, and wiping him, and lay him at full length, still
respectfully, in a baking-pan, with just enough water to
keep him from scorching. If large, score the back-bone
with a sharp knife, taking care not to mar the comeliness
of his red-spotted sides. Bake slowly, basting often with
butter and water. By the time he is done—and he should
be so well-looked after that his royal robe hardly shows a
seam or rent, and the red spots are still distinctly visible—have
ready in a saucepan a cup of cream—diluted with a
<i>few</i> spoonfuls of hot water, lest it should clot in heating—in
which have been stirred cautiously two tablespoonfuls
of melted butter and a little chopped parsley. Heat this
in a vessel set within another of boiling water, add the
gravy from the dripping-pan, boil up once to thicken, and
when the trout is laid—always respectfully—in a hot dish,
pour the sauce around him as he lies in state. He will
take kindly to the creamy bath, and your guests will take
kindly to him. Garnish with a wreath of crimson nasturtium
blooms and dainty sprigs of parsley, arranged by your
own hands on the edge of the dish, and let no sharply-spiced
sauces come near him. They would but mar his
native richness—the flavor he brought with him from the
lake and wild-wood. Salt him lightly, should he need it,
eat and be happy.</p>

<p>If the above savor of bathos rather than “common
sense,” my excuse is, I have lately eaten baked salmon-trout
with cream-gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Salmon-Trout.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and dry the trout; envelop in a thin cloth
fitted neatly to the shape of the fish, lay within a fish-kettle,
cover with salted water (cold), and boil gently
half an hour or longer, according to the size. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
done, unwrap and lay in a hot dish. Pour around it
cream-sauce made as for baked salmon-trout—only, of
course, with the omission of the fish-gravy—and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Trout.</span></h3>

<p>Brook trout are generally cooked in this way, and form
a rarely delightful breakfast or supper dish.</p>

<p>Clean, wash, and dry the fish, roll lightly in flour, and
fry in butter or clarified dripping, or butter and lard.
Let the fat be hot, fry quickly to a delicate brown, and
take up the instant they are done. Lay for an instant
upon a hot folded napkin, to absorb whatever grease may
cling to their speckled sides; then range side by side in a
heated dish, garnish, and send to the table. Use no seasoning
except salt, and that only when the fish are fried in
lard or unsalted dripping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Pickerel.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>The pickerel ranks next to trout among game-fish, and
should be fried in the same manner. Especially—and I
urge this with groaning of spirit, in remembrance of the
many times in which I have had my sense of fitness, not
to say my appetite, outraged by seeing the gallant fish
brought to table dried to a crisp throughout, all his juices
wasted and sweetness utterly departed—especially, do not
fry him slowly and too long; and when he is done, take
him out of the grease!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Pickerel.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Reserve your largest pickerel—those over three pounds
in weight—for baking, and proceed with them as with
baked salmon-trout—cream-gravy and all. If you cannot
afford cream, substitute rich milk, and thicken with rice
or wheat flour. The fish are better cooked in this way
than any other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Perch, and other Pan-fish.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and dry the fish. Lay them in a large
flat dish, salt, and dredge with flour. Have ready a frying-pan
of hot dripping, lard, or butter; put in as many
fish as the pan will hold without crowding, and fry to a
light brown. Send up hot in a chafing-dish.</p>

<p>The many varieties of pan-fish—porgies, flounders, river
bass, weak-fish, white-fish, etc., may be cooked in like manner.
In serving, lay the head of each fish to <i>the tail of
the one</i> next him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Cat-fish.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Skin, clean, and cut off the horribly homely heads.
Sprinkle with salt, to remove any muddy taste they may
have contracted from the flats or holes in which they have
fed, and let them lie in a cool place for an hour or so.
Then put them into a saucepan, cover with cold water,
and stew very gently for from half to three-quarters of an
hour, according to their size. Add a chopped shallot or
button-onion, a bunch of chopped parsley, a little pepper,
a large tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of flour
mixed to a paste with cold water; boil up once, take
out the fish carefully, and lay in a deep dish. Boil up
the gravy once more, and pour over the fish. Send to
table in a covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Cat-fish.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Skin, clean, and remove the heads. Sprinkle with
salt, and lay aside for an hour or more. Have ready two
or three eggs beaten to a froth, and, in a flat dish, a
quantity of powdered cracker. Dip the fish first in the
egg, then in the cracker, and fry quickly in hot lard or
dripping. Take up as quick as done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cat-fish Chowder.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, clean, and cut off the heads. Cut the fish into
pieces two inches long, and put into a pot with some fat
pork cut into shreds—a pound to a dozen medium-sized
fish, two chopped onions, or half a dozen shallots, a bunch
of sweet herbs, and pepper. The pork will salt it sufficiently.
Stew slowly for three-quarters of an hour. Then
stir in a cup of milk, thickened with a tablespoonful of
flour; take up a cupful of the hot liquor, and stir, a little
at a time, into two well-beaten eggs. Return this to the
pot, throw in half a dozen Boston or butter crackers,
split in half; let all boil up once, and turn into a tureen.
Pass sliced lemon or cucumber pickles, also sliced, with it.
Take out the backbones of the fish before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Eels.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Inquire, before buying, where they were caught, and
give so decided a preference to country eels as to refuse
those fattened upon the offal of city wharves. Nor are
the largest eels the best for eating. One weighing a pound
is better for your purpose than a bulky fellow that weighs
three.</p>

<p>Skin and clean, carefully extracting all the fat from the
inside. Cut into lengths of an inch and a half; put into
a saucepan, with enough cold water to cover them; throw
in a little salt and chopped parsley, and stew slowly,
closely covered, for at least an hour. Add, at the last, a
great spoonful of butter, and a little flour wet with cold
water, also pepper. Serve in a deep dish. The appearance
and odor of this stew are so pleasing as often to overcome
the prejudices of those who “Wouldn’t touch an eel
for the world! They look like snakes!” And those who
have tasted them rarely enter a second demurrer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Eels.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as for stewing; roll in flour, and fry, in hot
lard or dripping, to a light brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chowder</span> (<i>No. 1.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Take a pound of salt pork, cut into strips, and soak in
hot water five minutes. Cover the bottom of a pot with a
layer of this. Cut four pounds of cod or sea-bass into
pieces two inches square, and lay enough of these on the
pork to cover it. Follow with a layer of chopped onions,
a little parsley, summer savory, and pepper, either black or
cayenne. Then a layer of split Boston, or butter, or whole
cream crackers, which have been soaked in warm water
until moist through, but not ready to break. Above this
lay a stratum of pork, and repeat the order given above—onions,
seasoning, (not too much,) crackers, and pork,
until your materials are exhausted. Let the topmost
layer be buttered crackers, well soaked. Put in enough
cold water to cover all barely. Cover the pot, stew
gently for an hour, watching that the water does not sink
too low. Should it leave the upper layer exposed, replenish
constantly from the tea-kettle. When the chowder is
thoroughly done, take out with a perforated skimmer and
put into a tureen. Thicken the gravy with a tablespoonful
of flour and about the same quantity of butter. Boil
up and pour over the chowder. Send sliced lemon, pickles,
and stewed tomatoes to the table with it, that the
guests may add, if they like.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chowder</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>)</h3>

<p>Slice six large onions, and fry them in the gravy of
fried salt pork. Cut five pounds of bass or cod into
strips three inches long and one thick, and line the bottom
of a pot with them. Scatter a few slices of onion upon
them, a little salt, half a dozen whole black peppers, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
clove or two, a pinch of thyme and one of parsley,
a tablespoonful tomato or mushroom catsup, and six
oysters; then comes a layer of oyster crackers, well-soaked
in milk and buttered thickly. Another layer of fish,
onions, seasoning, and crackers, and so on until all are used
up. Cover with water, boil slowly for an hour and pour
out. Serve with capers and sliced lemon. A cup of oyster
liquor added to the chowder while boiling improves it.</p>



<h3>SHELL-FISH.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Boil a Lobster.</span></h3>

<p>Choose a lively one—not too large, lest he should be
tough. Put a handful of salt into a pot of boiling water,
and having tied the claws together, if your fish merchant
has not already skewered them, plunge him into the prepared
bath. He will be restive under this vigorous
hydropathic treatment; but allay your tortured sympathies
by the reflection that he is a cold-blooded animal,
destitute of imagination, and that pain, according to some
philosophers, exists only in the imagination. However this
may be, his suffering will be short-lived. Boil from half
an hour to an hour, as his size demands. When done,
draw out the scarlet innocent, and lay him, face downward,
in a sieve to dry. When cold, split open the body
and tail, and crack the claws to extract the meat, throwing
away the “lady fingers” and the head. Lobsters are
seldom served without dressing, upon private tables, as
few persons care to take the trouble of preparing their
own salad after taking their seats at the board.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Lobster.</span></h3>

<p>Extract the meat from a boiled lobster, as for salad, and
mince it finely; reserve the coral. Season highly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mustard, cayenne, salt, and some pungent sauce. Toss
and stir until it is well mixed, and put into a porcelain
saucepan (covered), with just enough hot water to keep it
from burning. Rub the coral smooth, moistening with
vinegar until it is thin enough to pour easily, then stir
into the contents of the saucepan. It is necessary to prepare
the dressing, let me say, before the lobster-meat is set
on the fire. It ought to boil up but once before the coral
and vinegar are put in. Next stir in a heaping tablespoonful
of butter, and when it boils again, take the pan
from the fire. Too much cooking toughens the meat.
This is a famous supper dish for sleighing parties.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Croquettes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>To the meat of a well-boiled lobster, chopped fine, add
pepper, salt, and powdered mace. Mix with this one-quarter
as much bread-crumbs, well rubbed, as you have
meat; make into ovates, or pointed balls, with two tablespoonfuls
of melted butter. Roll these in beaten egg, then
in pulverized cracker, and fry in butter or very nice sweet
lard. Serve dry and hot, and garnish with crisped parsley.
This is a delicious supper dish or <i>entrée</i> at dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Crab.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is prepared according to the receipt for devilled
lobster—substituting for the coral in the vinegar some
pulverized cracker, moistened first with a tablespoonful
of rich cream. You can serve up in the back-shell
of the crab if you like. Send in with cream crackers,
and stick a sprig of parsley in the top of each heap,
ranging the shells upon a large flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crab Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Mince the meat and dress as in lobster salad. Send in
the back-shell of the crab.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soft Crabs.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Many will not eat hard-shell crabs, considering them
indigestible, and not sufficiently palatable to compensate
for the risk they run in eating them. And it must be
owned that they are, at their best, but an indifferent substitute
for the more aristocratic lobster. But in the morning
of life, for him so often renewed, his crabship is a
different creature, and greatly affected by epicures.</p>

<p>Do not keep the crabs over night, as the shells harden
in twenty-four hours. Pull off the spongy substance from
the sides and the sand bags. These are the only portions
that are uneatable. Wash well, and wipe dry. Have
ready a pan of seething hot lard or butter, and fry them
to a fine brown. Put a little salt into the lard. The butter
will need none. Send up hot, garnished with parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Water-Turtles, or Terrapins.</span></h3>

<p>Land-terrapins, it is hardly necessary to say, are uneatable,
but the large turtle that frequents our mill-ponds and
rivers can be converted into a relishable article of food.</p>

<p>Plunge the turtle into a pot of boiling water, and let
him lie there five minutes. You can then skin the underpart
easily, and pull off the horny parts of the feet. Lay
him for ten minutes in <i>cold</i> salt and water; then put into
more hot water—salted, but not too much. Boil until
tender. The time will depend upon the size and age.
Take him out, drain, and wipe dry; loosen the shell carefully,
not to break the flesh; cut open also with care, lest
you touch the gall-bag with the knife. Remove this with
the entrails and sand-bag. Cut up all the rest of the
animal into small bits, season with pepper, salt, a chopped
onion, sweet herbs, and a teaspoonful of some spiced sauce,
or a tablespoonful of catsup—walnut or mushroom. Save
the juice that runs from the meat, and put all together into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a saucepan with a closely fitting top. Stew gently fifteen
minutes, stirring occasionally, and add a great spoonful of
butter, a tablespoonful of browned flour wet in cold water,
a glass of brown Sherry, and lastly, the beaten yolk of an
egg, mixed with a little of the hot liquor, that it may not
curdle. Boil up once, and turn into a covered dish.
Send around green pickles and delicate slices of dry toast
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Drain the liquor from two quarts of firm, plump oysters;
mix with it a small teacupful of hot water, add a little salt
and pepper, and set over the fire in a saucepan. Let it
boil up once, put in the oysters, let them boil for five
minutes or less—not more. When they “ruffle,” add two
tablespoonfuls of butter. The instant it is melted and well
stirred in, put in a large cupful of boiling milk and take
the saucepan from the fire. Serve with oyster or cream
crackers, as soon as possible. Oysters become tough and
tasteless when cooked too much, or left to stand too long
after they are withdrawn from the fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Oysters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Use for frying the largest and best oysters you can find.
Take them carefully from the liquor; lay them in rows
upon a clean cloth, and press another lightly upon them
to absorb the moisture. Have ready some crackers crushed
fine. In the frying-pan heat enough nice butter to cover
the oysters entirely. Dip each oyster into the cracker,
rolling it over that it may become completely incrusted.
Drop them carefully into the frying-pan, and fry quickly
to a light brown. If the butter is hot enough they will
soon be ready to take out. Test it by putting in one
oyster before you risk the rest. Do not let them lie in
the pan an instant after they are done. Serve dry, and
let the dish be warm. A chafing-dish is best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Fritters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters, and to a cupful of
this add the same quantity of milk, three eggs, a little salt,
and flour enough for a thin batter. Chop the oysters and
stir into the batter. Have ready in the frying-pan a few
spoonfuls of lard, or half lard, half butter; heat very hot,
and drop the oyster-batter in by the tablespoonful. Try
a spoonful first, to satisfy yourself that the lard is hot
enough, and that the fritter is of the right size and consistency.
Take rapidly from the pan as soon as they are
done to a pleasing yellow brown, and send to table very
hot.</p>

<p>Some fry the oyster whole, enveloped in batter, one in
each fritter. In this case, the batter should be thicker
than if the chopped oysters were to be added.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Crush and roll several handfuls of Boston or other friable
crackers. Put a layer in the bottom of a buttered
pudding-dish. Wet this with a mixture of the oyster liquor
and milk, slightly warmed. Next, have a layer of oysters.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay small bits of butter
upon them. Then another layer of moistened crumbs, and
so on until the dish is full. Let the top layer be of crumbs,
thicker than the rest, and beat an egg into the milk you
pour over them. Stick bits of butter thickly over it, cover
the dish, set it in the oven, bake half an hour; if the dish
be large, remove the cover, and brown by setting it upon
the upper grating of oven, or by holding a hot shovel over
it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Oysters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Choose large, fat oysters; wipe them very dry; sprinkle
salt and cayenne pepper upon them, and broil upon one
of the small gridirons sold for that purpose. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dredge the oyster with cracker-dust or flour if you wish to
have it brown, and some fancy the juices are better kept in
in this way. Others dislike the crust thus formed. Butter
the gridiron well, and let your fire be hot and clear. If
the oyster drip, withdraw the gridiron for an instant until
the smoke clears away. Broil quickly and dish hot, putting
a tiny piece of butter, not larger than a pea, upon
each oyster.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Oysters on the Half-shell.</span></h3>

<p>Pour into your inner saucepan a cup of hot water, another
of milk, and one of cream, with a little salt. Set
into a kettle of hot water until it boils, when stir in two
tablespoonfuls of butter and a little salt, with white pepper.
Take from the fire and add two heaping tablespoonfuls
of arrow-root, rice-flour, or corn-starch, wet with cold
milk. By this time your shells should be washed and
buttered, and a fine oyster laid within each. Of course, it
is <i>selon les régles</i> to use oyster-shells for this purpose; but
you will find clam-shells more roomy and manageable,
because more regular in shape. Range these closely in a
large baking-pan, propping them with clean pebbles or
fragments of shell, if they do not seem inclined to retain
their contents. Stir the cream <i>very</i> hard and fill up each
shell with a spoon, taking care not to spill any in the pan.
Bake five or six minutes in a hot oven after the shells
become warm. Serve on the shell. Some substitute
oyster-liquor for the water in the mixture, and use all milk
instead of cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Omelet.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>12 oysters, if large; double the number of small ones.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Chop the oysters very fine. Beat the yolks and whites
of the eggs separately as for nice cake—the white until
it stands in a heap. Put three tablespoonfuls of butter
in a frying-pan, and heat while you are mixing the omelet.
Stir the milk into a deep dish with the yolk, and season.
Next put in the chopped oysters, beating vigorously as
you add them gradually. When they are thoroughly incorporated,
pour in the spoonful of melted butter; finally,
whip in the whites lightly and with as few strokes as possible.
If the butter is hot, and it ought to be, that the
omelet may not stand uncooked, put the mixture into the
pan. <i>Do not stir it</i>, but when it begins to stiffen—“to
set,” in culinary phrase, slip a broad-bladed, round-pointed
dinner-knife around the sides, and cautiously under the
omelet, that the butter may reach every part. As soon
as the centre is fairly “set,” turn out into a hot dish. Lay
the latter bottom upward over the frying-pan, which must
be turned upside-down dexterously. This brings the
browned side of the omelet uppermost. This omelet is
delicious and easily made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make a rich puff-paste; roll out twice as thick as for a
fruit-pie for the top crust—about the ordinary thickness
for the lower. Line a pudding-dish with the thinner, and
fill with crusts of dry bread or light crackers. Some use
a folded towel to fill the interior of the pie, but the above
expedient is preferable. Butter the edges of the dish,
that you may be able to lift the upper crust without
breaking. Cover the mock-pie with the thick crust, ornamented
heavily at the edge, that it may lie the more quietly,
and bake. Cook the oysters as for a stew, only
beating into them at the last two eggs, and thickening with
a spoonful of fine cracker-crumbs or rice-flour. They should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stew but five minutes, and time them so that the paste
will be baked just in season to receive them. Lift the top
crust, pour in the smoking hot oysters, and send up hot.</p>

<p>I know that many consider it unnecessary to prepare
the oysters and crust separately; but my experience
and observation go to prove that, if this precaution be
omitted, the oysters are apt to be wofully overdone. The
reader can try both methods and take her choice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Oysters.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>100 large oysters.</li>
<li>1 pt. white wine vinegar.</li>
<li>1 doz. blades of mace.</li>
<li>2 doz. whole cloves.</li>
<li>2 doz. whole black peppers.</li>
<li>1 large red pepper broken into bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put oysters, liquor and all, into a porcelain or bell-metal
kettle. Salt to taste. Heat slowly until the oysters
are very hot, but not to boiling. Take them out with a
perforated skimmer, and set aside to cool. To the liquor
which remains in the kettle add the vinegar and spices.
Boil up fairly, and when the oysters are almost cold, pour
over them scalding hot. Cover the jar in which they are,
and put away in a cool place. Next day put the pickled
oysters into glass cans with tight tops. Keep in the dark,
and where they are not liable to become heated.</p>

<p>I have kept oysters thus prepared for three weeks in the
winter. If you open a can, use the contents up as soon
as practicable. The air, like the light, will turn them
dark.</p>

<p>It is little trouble for every housekeeper to put up the
pickled oysters needed in her family; and besides the
satisfaction she will feel in the consciousness that the materials
used are harmless, and the oysters sound, she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
save at least one-third of the price of those she would buy
ready pickled. The colorless vinegar used by “professionals”
for such purposes is usually sulphuric or pyroligneous
acid. If you doubt this, pour a little of the liquor
from the pickled oysters put up by your obliging oyster-dealer
into a bell-metal kettle. I tried it once, and the
result was a liquid that matched the clear green of Niagara
in hue.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>There is no pleasanter frolic for an Autumn evening, in
the regions where oysters are plentiful, than an impromptu
“roast” in the kitchen. There the oysters are hastily
thrown into the fire by the peck. You may consider that
your fastidious taste is marvellously respected if they are
washed first. A bushel basket is set to receive the empty
shells, and the click of the oyster-knives forms a constant
accompaniment to the music of laughing voices. Nor
are roast oysters amiss upon your own quiet supper-table,
when the “good man” comes in on a wet night, tired and
hungry, and wants “something heartening.” Wash and
wipe the shell-oysters, and lay them in the oven, if it is
quick; upon the top of the stove, if it is not. When they
open, they are done. Pile in a large dish and send to
table. Remove the upper shell by a dexterous wrench of
the knife, season the oyster on the lower, with pepper-sauce
and butter, or pepper, salt, and vinegar in lieu of
the sauce, and you have the very aroma of this pearl of
bivalves, pure and undefiled.</p>

<p>Or, you may open while raw, leaving the oysters upon
the lower shells; lay in a large baking-pan, and roast in
their own liquor, adding pepper, salt, and butter before
serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>It is fashionable to serve these as one of the preliminaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to a dinner-party; sometimes in small plates, sometimes
on the half-shell. They are seasoned by each guest
according to his own taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>If you have no steamer, improvise one by the help of a
cullender and a pot-lid fitting closely into it, at a little
distance from the top. Wash some shell oysters and lay
them in such a position in the bottom of the cullender that
the liquor will not escape from them when the shell opens,
that is, with the upper shell down. Cover with a cloth
thrown over the top of the cullender, and press the lid hard
down upon this to exclude the air. Set over a pot of boiling
water so deep that the cullender, which should fit into
the mouth, does not touch the water. Boil hard for twenty
minutes, then make a hasty examination of the oysters. If
they are open, you are safe in removing the cover. Serve
on the half-shell, or upon a hot chafing dish. Sprinkle a
little salt over them and a few bits of butter; but be quick
in whatever you do, for the glory of the steamed oyster is
to be eaten hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Pâtés.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 qt. oysters.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper, and a pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set the oysters, with enough liquor to cover them, in a
saucepan upon the range or stove; let them come to a boil;
skim well, and stir in the butter and seasoning. Two or
three spoonsful of cream will improve them. Have ready
small tins lined with puff paste. Put three or four oysters
in each, according to the size of the <i>pâté</i>; cover with paste
and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. For open <i>pâtés</i>,
cut the paste into round cakes: those intended for the
bottom crust less than an eighth of an inch thick; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
upper, a little thicker. With a smaller cutter, remove a
round of paste from the middle of the latter, leaving a neat
ring. Lay this carefully upon the bottom crust; place a
second ring upon this, that the cavity may be deep enough
to hold the oysters; lay the pieces you have extracted also
in the pan with the rest, and bake to a fine brown in a
<i>quick</i> oven. When done, wash over with beaten egg, around
top and all, and set in the oven three minutes to glaze.
Fill the cavity with a mixture prepared as below, fit on
the top lightly, and serve.</p>


<h3><i>Mixture.</i></h3>

<p>Boil half the liquor from a quart of oysters. Put in all
the oysters, leaving out the uncooked liquor; heat to boiling,
and stir in—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ cup of hot milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls corn starch, wet with a little milk.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil four minutes, stirring all the time until it thickens,
and fill the cavity in the paste shells. These <i>pâtés</i> are
very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scallops.</span></h3>

<p>The heart is the only part used. If you buy them in
the shell, boil and take out the hearts. Those sold in
our markets are generally ready for frying or stewing.</p>

<p>Dip them in beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs and
fry in hot lard.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may stew like oysters. The fried scallops are generally
preferred.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Clams.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the clams fine, and season with pepper and salt.
Cayenne pepper is thought to give a finer flavor than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
black or white; but to some palates it is insufferable.
Mix in another dish some powdered cracker, moistened
first with warm milk, then with the clam liquor, a beaten
egg or two, and some melted butter. Stir in with this
the chopped clams. Wash as many clam-shells as the
mixture will fill; wipe and butter them; fill, heaping up
and smoothing over with a silver knife or teaspoon.
Range in rows in your baking-pan, and cook until nicely
browned. Or, if you do not care to be troubled with the
shells, bake in patty-pans, sending to table hot in the
tins, as you would in the scallop-shells.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Fritters.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>12 clams, minced fine.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the liquor from the clams to the milk; beat up the
eggs and put to this, with salt and pepper, and flour
enough for thin batter; lastly, the chopped clams. Fry
in hot lard, trying a little first to see that fat and batter
are right. A tablespoonful will make a fritter of moderate
size. Or, you can dip the whole clams in batter and
cook in like manner. Fry quickly, or they are apt to be
too greasy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Chowder.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Fry five or six slices of fat pork crisp, and chop to
pieces. Sprinkle some of these in the bottom of a pot;
lay upon them a stratum of clams; sprinkle with cayenne
or black pepper and salt, and scatter bits of butter profusely
over all; next, have a layer of chopped onions,
then one of small crackers, split and moistened with
warm milk. On these pour a little of the fat left in the
pan after the pork is fried, and then comes a new round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of pork, clams, onion, etc. Proceed in this order until
the pot is nearly full, when cover with water, and stew
slowly—the pot closely covered—for three-quarters of an
hour. Drain off all the liquor that will flow freely, and,
when you have turned the chowder into the tureen, return
the gravy to the pot. Thicken with flour, or, better
still, pounded crackers; add a glass of wine, some catsup,
and spiced sauce; boil up, and pour over the contents of
the tureen. Send around walnut or butternut pickles
with it.</p>



<h3>POULTRY.</h3>

<p>Poultry should never be eaten in less than six or eight
hours after it is killed; but it should be picked and drawn
as soon as possible. There is no direr disgrace to our
Northern markets than the practice of sending whole
dead fowls to market. I have bought such from responsible
poultry dealers, and found them uneatable, from
having remained undrawn until the flavor of the craw
and intestines had impregnated the whole body. Those
who are conversant with the habit of careful country
housewives, of keeping up a fowl without food for a day
and night before killing and dressing for their own eating,
cannot but regard with disgust the surcharged crops and
puffy sides of those sold <i>by weight</i> in the shambles. If
you want to know what you really pay for poultry bought
in these circumstances, weigh the offal extracted from the
fowl by your cook, and deduct from the market weight.
“But don’t you know it actually poisons a fowl to lie so
long undressed?” once exclaimed a Southern lady to me.
“In <i>our</i> markets they are offered for sale ready picked
and drawn, with the giblets—also cleaned—tucked under
their wings.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>I know nothing about the poisonous nature of the entrails
and crops. I do assert that the custom is unclean
and unjust. And this I do without the remotest hope of
arousing my fellow-housekeepers to remonstrance against
established usage. Only it relieves my mind somewhat to
grumble at what I cannot help. The best remedy I can
propose for the grievance is to buy live fowls, and, before
sending them home, ask your butcher to decapitate them;
the probabilities being greatly in favor of the supposition
that your cook is too “tinder-hearted” to attempt the job.</p>

<p>One word as to the manner of roasting meats and fowls.
In this day of ranges and cooking-stoves, I think I am
speaking within bounds when I assume that not one housekeeper
in fifty uses a spit, or even a tin kitchen, for such
purposes. It is in vain that the writers of receipt-books
inform us with refreshing <i>naïveté</i> that all our meats are
baked, not roasted, and expatiate upon the superior flavor
of those prepared upon the English spits and in old fashioned
kitchens, where enormous wood-fires blazed from
morning until night. I shall not soon forget my perplexity
when, an inexperienced housekeeper and a firm believer
in all “that was writ” by older and wiser people, I stood
before my neat Mott’s “Defiance,” a fine sirloin of beef
ready to be cooked on the table behind me, and read from
my Instruction-book that my “fire should extend at least
eight inches beyond the roaster on either side!” I am
not denying the virtues of spits and tin kitchens—only
regretting that they are not within the reach of every one.
In view of this fact, let me remark, for the benefit of the
unfortunate many, that, in the opinion of excellent judges,
the practice of roasting meat in close ovens has advantages.
Of these I need mention but two, to wit, the preservation
of the flavor of the article roasted, and the prevention of
its escape to the upper regions of the dwelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>After drawing the turkey, rinse out with several waters,
and in next to the last mix a teaspoonful of soda. The
inside of a fowl, especially if purchased in the market, is
sometimes very sour, and imparts an unpleasant taste to
the stuffing, if not to the inner part of the legs and side-bones.
The soda will act as a corrective, and is moreover
very cleansing. Fill the body with this water, shake well,
empty it out, and rinse with fair water. Then prepare a
dressing of bread-crumbs, mixed with butter, pepper, salt,
thyme or sweet marjoram. You may, if you like, add the
beaten yolks of two eggs. A little chopped sausage is
esteemed an improvement when well incorporated with the
other ingredients. Or, mince a dozen oysters and stir into
the dressing. The effect upon the turkey-meat, particularly
that of the breast, is very pleasant.</p>

<p>Stuff the craw with this, and tie a string tightly about
the neck, to prevent the escape of the stuffing. Then fill
the body of the turkey, and sew it up with strong thread.
This and the neck-string are to be removed when the fowl
is dished. In roasting, if your fire is brisk, allow about
ten minutes to a pound; but it will depend very much
upon the turkey’s age whether this rule holds good. Dredge
it with flour before roasting, and baste often; at first with
butter and water, afterward with the gravy in the dripping-pan.
If you lay the turkey in the pan, put in with it a
teacup of hot water. Many roast always upon a grating
placed on the top of the pan. In that case the boiling
water steams the underpart of the fowl, and prevents the
skin from drying too fast, or cracking. Roast to a fine
brown, and if it threaten to darken too rapidly, lay a sheet
of white paper over it until the lower part is also done.</p>

<p>Stew the chopped giblets in just enough water to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
them, and when the turkey is lifted from the pan, add
these, with the water in which they were boiled, to the
drippings; thicken with a spoonful of browned flour, wet
with cold water to prevent lumping, boil up once, and pour
into the gravy-boat. If the turkey is fat, skim the drippings
well before putting in the giblets.</p>

<p>Serve with cranberry sauce. Some lay fried oysters in
the dish around the turkey.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>Chop about two dozen oysters, and mix with them a
dressing compounded as for roast turkey, only with more
butter. Stuff the turkey as for roasting, craw and body,
and baste about it a thin cloth, fitted closely to every part.
The inside of the cloth should be dredged with flour to
prevent the fowl from sticking to it. Allow fifteen minutes
to a pound, and boil slowly.</p>

<p>Serve with oyster-sauce, made by adding to a cupful of
the liquor in which the turkey was boiled, eight oysters
chopped fine. Season with minced parsley, stir in a spoonful
of rice or wheat flour, wet with cold milk, a tablespoonful
of butter. Add a cupful of hot milk. Boil up
once and pour into an oyster-tureen. Send around celery
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey Scallop.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the bones of a cold boiled or roasted
turkey left from yesterday’s dinner. Remove the bits of
skin and gristle, and chop up the rest very fine. Put in
the bottom of a buttered dish a layer of cracker or bread-crumbs;
moisten slightly with milk, that they may not
absorb all the gravy to be poured in afterward; then spread
a layer of the minced turkey, with bits of the stuffing, pepper,
salt, and small pieces of butter. Another layer of
cracker, wet with milk, and so on until the dish is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
full. Before putting on the topmost layer, pour in the
gravy left from the turkey, diluted—should there not be
enough—with hot water, and seasoned with Worcestershire
sauce, or catsup, and butter. Have ready a crust of
cracker-crumbs soaked in warm milk, seasoned with salt,
and beaten up light with two eggs. It should be just thick
enough to spread smoothly over the top of the scallop.
Stick bits of butter plentifully upon it, and bake. Turn a
deep plate over the dish until the contents begin to bubble
at the sides, showing that the whole is thoroughly
cooked; then remove the cover, and brown. A large
pudding-dish full of the mixture will be cooked in three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>This, like many other economical dishes, will prove so
savory as to claim a frequent appearance upon any table.</p>

<p>Cold chicken may be prepared in the same way</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p>The minced turkey, dressing, and cracker-crumbs may
be wet with gravy, two eggs beaten into it, and the force-meat
thus made rolled into oblong shapes, dipped in egg
and pounded cracker, and fried like croquettes, for a side
dish, to “make out” a dinner of ham or cold meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>This is also a cheap, yet nice dish. Cut the cold turkey
from the bones and into bits an inch long with knife
and fork, tearing as little as possible. Put into a skillet
or saucepan the gravy left from the roast, with hot water
to dilute it should the quantity be small. Add a lump of
butter the size of an egg, a teaspoonful of pungent sauce,
a large pinch of nutmeg, with a little salt. Let it boil,
and put in the meat. Stew very slowly for ten minutes—not
more—and stir in a tablespoonful of cranberry or currant
jelly, another of browned flour which has been wet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cold water; lastly, a glass of brown Sherry or Madeira.
Boil up once, and serve in a covered dish for breakfast.
Leave out the stuffing entirely; it is no improvement to the
flavor, and disfigures the appearance of the ragoût.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Having picked and drawn them, wash out well in two
or three waters, adding a little soda to the last but one
should any doubtful odor linger about the cavity. Prepare
a stuffing of bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, &amp;c.
Fill the bodies and crops of the chickens, which should be
young and plump; sew them up, and roast an hour or
more, in proportion to their size. Baste two or three
times with butter and water, afterward with their own
gravy. If laid flat within the dripping pan, put in at the
first a little hot water to prevent burning.</p>

<p>Stew the giblets and necks in enough water to cover
them, and, when you have removed the fowls to a hot
dish, pour this into the drippings; boil up once; add the
giblets, chopped fine; thicken with browned flour; boil
again, and send to table in a gravy-boat.</p>

<p>Serve with crab-apple jelly or tomato sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff as for roasting. Baste a floured
cloth around each, and put into a pot with enough boiling
water to cover them well. The hot water cooks the skin
at once, and prevents the escape of the juices. The broth
will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in cold water,
but this is a proof that the meat will be more nutritious
and better flavored. Stew very slowly, for the first half
hour especially. Boil an hour or more, guiding yourself
by size and toughness.</p>

<p>Serve with <a href="#Egg_Sauce">egg</a> or <a href="#Bread_Sauce">bread sauce</a>. (See <i><a href="#SAUCES_FOR_MEAT_AND_FISH">Sauces</a></i>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken.</span> (<i>White.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut up the fowls, which need not be so
tender as for roasting. Lay them in salt and water for
half an hour. Put them in a pot with enough cold
water to cover them, and half a pound of salt pork cut
into thin strips. Cover closely, and let them heat very
slowly; then stew for over an hour, if the fowls are tender.
I have used chickens for this purpose that required four
hours stewing, but they were tender and good when done.
Only put them on in season, and cook very slowly. If
they boil fast, they toughen and shrink into uneatableness.
When tender, add a chopped onion or two, parsley, and
pepper. Cover closely again, and, when it has heated to
boiling, stir in a teacupful of milk, to which have been
added two beaten eggs and two tablespoonfuls of flour.
Boil up fairly; add a great spoonful of butter. Arrange
the chicken neatly in a deep chafing-dish, pour the gravy
over it, and serve.</p>

<p>In this, as in all cases where beaten egg is added to hot
liquor, it is best to dip out a few spoonfuls of the latter,
and drop a little at a time into the egg, beating all the
while, that it may heat evenly and gradually before it is
put into the scalding contents of the saucepan or pot.
Eggs managed in this way will not curdle, as they are apt
to do if thrown suddenly into hot liquid.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken.</span> (<i>Brown.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut up a pair of young chickens. Lay
in clear water for half an hour. If they are old, you
cannot brown them well. Put them in a saucepan, with
enough cold water to cover them well, and set over the
fire to heat slowly. Meanwhile, cut half a pound of salt
pork into strips, and fry crisp. Take them out, chop fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and put into the pot with the chicken. Fry in the fat left
in the frying-pan one large onion, or two or three small
ones, cut into slices. Let them brown well, and add them
also to the chicken, with a quarter teaspoonful of allspice
and cloves. Stew all together slowly for an hour or more,
until the meat is very tender; you can test this with a fork.
Take out the pieces of fowl and put in a hot dish, covering
closely until the gravy is ready. Add to this a great
spoonful of walnut or other dark catsup, and nearly three
tablespoonfuls of browned flour, a little chopped parsley,
and a glass of brown Sherry. Boil up once; strain through
a cullender, to remove the bits of pork and onion; return
to the pot, with the chicken; let it come to a final boil,
and serve, pouring the gravy over the pieces of fowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>It is possible to render a tough fowl eatable by boiling
or stewing it with care. <i>Never</i> broil such! And even
when assured that your “broiler” is young, it is wise to
make this doubly sure by laying it upon sticks extending
from side to side of a dripping-pan full of boiling water.
Set this in the oven, invert a tin pan over the chicken, and
let it steam for half an hour. This process relaxes the
muscles, and renders supple the joints, besides preserving
the juices that would be lost in parboiling. The chicken
should be split down the back, and wiped perfectly dry
before it is steamed. Transfer from the vapor-bath to a
buttered gridiron, inside downward. Cover with a tin pan
or common plate, and broil until tender and brown, turning
several times; from half to three-quarters of an hour
will be sufficient. Put into a hot chafing-dish, and butter
very well. Send to table smoking hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Chicken</span> (<i>No. 1</i>).</h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut to pieces a couple of Spring chickens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Have ready in a frying-pan enough boiling lard or
dripping to cover them well. Dip each piece in beaten
egg when you have salted it, then in cracker-crumbs, and
fry until brown. If the chicken is large, steam it before
frying, as directed in the foregoing receipt. When you
have taken out the meat, throw into the hot fat a dozen
sprigs of parsley, and let them remain a minute—just
long enough to crisp, but not to dry them. Garnish the
chicken by strewing these over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Chicken</span> (<i>No. 2</i>).</h3>

<p>Cut up half a pound of fat salt pork in a frying-pan,
and fry until the grease is extracted, but not until it
browns. Wash and cut up a young chicken (broiling
size), soak in salt and water for half an hour; wipe dry,
season with pepper, and dredge with flour; then fry in the
hot fat until each piece is a rich brown on both sides.
Take up, drain, and set aside in a hot covered dish. Pour
into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cup of milk—half
cream is better; thicken with a spoonful of flour and a
tablespoonful of butter; add some chopped parsley, boil
up, and pour over the hot chicken. This is a standard
dish in the Old Dominion, and tastes nowhere else as it
does when eaten on Virginia soil. The cream gravy is
often omitted, and the chicken served up dry, with
bunches of fried parsley dropped upon it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Pot-pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line the bottom and sides of a pot with a good rich
paste, reserving enough for a top crust and for the square
bits to be scattered through the pie. Butter the pot very
lavishly, or your pastry will stick to it and burn. Cut up
a fine large fowl, and half a pound of corned ham or salt
pork. Put in a layer of the latter, pepper it, and cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
with pieces of the chicken, and this with the paste dumplings
or squares. If you use potatoes, parboil them before
putting them into the pie, as the first water in which they
are boiled is rank and unwholesome. The potatoes should
be sliced and laid next the pastry squares; then another
layer of pork, and so on until your chicken is used up.
Cover with pastry rolled out quite thick, and slit this in
the middle. Heat very slowly, and boil two hours. Turn
into a large dish, the lower crust on top, and the gravy
about it.</p>

<p>This is the old-fashioned pot-pie, dear to the memory of
men who were school-boys thirty and forty years ago. If
you are not experienced in such manufactures, you had
better omit the lower crust; and, having browned the
upper, by putting a hot pot-lid or stove-cover on top of
the pot for some minutes, remove dexterously without
breaking. Pour out the chicken into a dish, and set the
crust above it.</p>

<p>Veal, beef-steak, lamb (not mutton), hares, &amp;c., may
be substituted for the chicken. The pork will salt it
sufficiently.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Chicken Pie</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made as above, but baked in a buttered pudding-dish,
and, in place of the potatoes, three hard-boiled eggs are
chopped up and strewed among the pieces of chicken. If
the chickens are tough, or even doubtful, parboil them before
making the pie, adding the water in which they were
boiled, instead of cold water, for gravy. If they are
lean, put in a few bits of butter. Ornament with leaves
cut out with a cake-cutter, and a star in the centre.
Bake an hour—more, if the pie is large.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut up as for fricassee, and parboil, seasoning well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pepper, salt, and a lump of butter the size of an egg, to
each chicken. The fowls should be young and tender, and
divided at every joint. Stew slowly for half an hour, take
them out, and lay on a flat dish to cool. Set aside the
water in which they were stewed for your gravy.</p>

<p>Make a batter of one quart of milk, three cups of
flour, three tablespoonfuls melted butter, half a teaspoonful
soda, and one spoonful of cream tartar, with four eggs
well beaten, and a little salt. Put a layer of chicken in
the bottom of the dish, and pour about half a cupful of
batter over it—enough to conceal the meat; then, another
layer of chicken, and more batter, until the dish is full.
The batter must form the crust. Bake one hour, in a
moderate oven, if the dish is large.</p>

<p>Beat up an egg, and stir into the gravy which was set
aside; thicken with two teaspoonfuls of rice or wheat flour,
add a little chopped parsley; boil up, and send it to table
in a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Ham.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Draw, wash, and stuff a pair of young fowls. Cut
enough large, thick slices of cold boiled ham to envelop
these entirely, wrapping them up carefully, and winding a
string about all, to prevent the ham from falling off. Put
into your dripping-pan, with a little water to prevent
scorching; dashing it over the meat lest it should dry and
shrink. Invert a tin pan over all, and bake slowly for one
hour and a quarter, if the fowls are small and tender—longer,
if tough. Lift the cover from time to time to baste
with the drippings—the more frequently as time wears
on. Test the tenderness of the fowls, by sticking a fork
through the ham into the breast. When done, undo the
strings, lay the fowls in a hot dish, and the slices of ham
about them. Stir into the dripping a little chopped parsley,
a tablespoonful of browned flour wet in cold water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pepper, and let it boil up once. Pour some of it over the
chickens—not enough to float the ham in the dish; serve
the rest in a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe the ducks very carefully. To the
usual dressing add a little sage (powdered or green), and
a minced shallot. Stuff, and sew up as usual, reserving the
giblets for the gravy. If they are tender, they will not require
more than an hour to roast. Baste well. Skim the
gravy before putting in the giblets and thickening. The
giblets should be stewed in a very little water, then chopped
fine, and added to the gravy in the dripping-pan, with a
chopped shallot and a spoonful of browned flour.</p>

<p>Accompany with currant or grape jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Use up Cold Duck.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>I may say, as preface, that cold duck is in itself an excellent
supper dish, or side dish, at a family dinner, and is
often preferred to hot. If the duck has been cut into at all,
divide neatly into joints, and slice the breast, laying slices
of dressing about it. Garnish with lettuce or parsley, and
eat with jelly.</p>

<p>But if a warm dish is desired, cut the meat from the
bones and lay in a saucepan, with a little minced cold
ham; pour on just enough water to cover it, and stir in a
tablespoonful of butter. Cover, and heat gradually, until
it is <i>near</i> boiling. Then add the gravy, diluted with a little
hot water; a great spoonful of catsup, one of Worcestershire
sauce, and one of currant or cranberry jelly, with a
glass of wine and a tablespoonful of browned flour.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may put the gravy, with a little hot water and a lump
of butter, in a frying-pan, and when it is hot lay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
pieces of duck, and warm up quickly, stirring in at the
last a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a tablespoonful
of jelly.</p>

<p>Serve in a hot chafing-dish.</p>

<p>(For wild ducks, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#GAME">Game</a></span>.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Duck.</span></h3>

<p>This is a good way to treat an old tough fowl.</p>

<p>Clean and divide, as you would a chicken for fricassee.
Put in a saucepan, with several (minced) slices of cold
ham or salt pork which is not too fat, and stew slowly for
at least an hour—keeping the lid on all the while. Then
stir in a chopped onion, a half-spoonful of powdered sage,
or of the green leaves cut fine, half as much parsley, a tablespoonful
catsup, and black pepper. Stew another half-hour,
or until the duck is tender, and add a teaspoonful
brown sugar, and a tablespoonful of browned flour, previously
wet with cold water. Boil up once, and serve in
a deep covered dish, with green peas as an accompaniment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guinea Fowls.</span></h3>

<p>Many are not aware what an excellent article of food
these speckled Arabs of the poultry-yard are. They are
kept chiefly for the beauty of their plumage, and their delicious
eggs, which are far richer than those of chickens.</p>

<p>Unless young they are apt to be tough, and the dark
color of the meat is objected to by those who are not fond
of, or used to eating game. Cooked according to the foregoing
receipt they are very savory, no matter how old they
may be. Put them on early, and stew <i>slowly</i>, and good
management will bring the desired end to pass. There is
nothing in the shape of game or poultry that is not amenable
to this process, providing the salt be omitted until
the meat is tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>But a pair of young Guinea fowls, stuffed and roasted,
basting them with butter until they are half done, deserve
an honorable place upon our bill of fare. Season the
gravy with a chopped shallot, parsley, or summer savory,
not omitting the minced giblets, and thicken with browned
flour. Send around currant, or other tart jelly, with the
fowl. A little ham, minced fine, improves the dressing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Goose.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash the goose—not forgetting to put a spoonful
of soda in next to the last water, rinse out well, and
wipe the inside quite dry. Add to the usual stuffing of
bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, etc., a tablespoonful melted
butter, an onion chopped fine, a tablespoonful chopped
sage, the yolks of two eggs, and some minute bits of fat
pork. Stuff body and craw, and sew up. It will take
fully two hours to roast, if the fire is strong. Cover the
breast, until it is half done, with white paper, or a paste
of flour and water, removing this when you are ready to
brown.</p>

<p>Make a gravy as for roast duck, adding a glass of Sherry
or Madeira, or (if you can get it) old Port.</p>

<p>Send to table with cranberry or apple sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Goose Pie.</span></h3>

<p>An old goose is as nearly good for nothing as it is possible
for anything which was once valuable, and is not now
absolutely spoiled, to be. The best use to put it to is to
make it into a pie, in the following manner. Put on the
ancient early in the morning, in cold water enough to
cover it, unsalted, having cut it to pieces at every joint.
Warm it up gradually, and let it stew—not boil hard—for
four or five hours. Should the water need replenishing,
let it be done from the boiling kettle. Parboil a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
beef’s tongue (corned), cut into slices nearly half an inch
thick; also slice six hard-boiled eggs. Line a deep pudding-dish
with a good paste; lay in the pieces of goose, the
giblets chopped, the sliced tongue and egg, in consecutive
layers; season with pepper, salt, and bits of butter, and
proceed in this order until the dish is full. If the goose
be large, cut the meat from the bones after stewing, and
leave out the latter entirely. Intersperse with strips of
paste, and fill up with the gravy in which the goose was
stewed, thickened with flour. Cover with a thick paste,
and when it is done, brush over the top with beaten white
of egg.</p>

<p>In cold weather this pie will keep a week, and is very
good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff as you would chickens. Lay
them in rows, if roasted in the oven, with a little water in
the pan to prevent scorching. Unless they are very fat,
baste with butter until they are half done, afterwards
with their own gravy. Thicken the gravy that drips
from them, and boil up once; then pour into a gravy-boat.
The pigeons should lie close together in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Pick, draw, clean and stuff as above directed. Put the
pigeons in a deep pot with enough cold water to cover
them, and stew gently for an hour, or until, testing them
with a fork, you find them tender. Then season with
pepper, salt, a few blades of mace, a little sweet marjoram,
and a good piece of butter. Stew, or rather simmer, for
five minutes longer—then stir in a tablespoonful of browned
flour. Let it boil up once; remove the pigeons, draw out
the strings with which they were sewed up, and serve,
pouring the hot gravy over them. A little salt pork or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ham, cut into strips, is an improvement. This should be
put in when the pigeons have stewed half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Pigeons or Squabs.</span></h3>

<p>Young pigeons or “squabs” are rightly esteemed a
great delicacy. They are cleaned, washed, and dried
carefully with a clean cloth; then split down the back,
and broiled like chickens. Season with pepper and salt,
and butter liberally in dishing them. They are in great
request in a convalescent’s room, being peculiarly savory
and nourishing.</p>

<p>They may, for a change, be roasted whole, according to
the receipt for roast pigeons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pigeon Pie.</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is best made of wild pigeons.    (<span class="smcap">See <a href="#GAME">Game</a>.</span>)</p>



<h3>MEATS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>The best pieces for roasting are the sirloin and rib
pieces. The latter are oftenest used by small families.
Make your butcher remove most of the bone, and skewer
the meat into the shape of a round. If you roast in an
oven, it is a good plan to dash a small cup of <i>boiling</i>
water over the meat in first putting it down, letting it
trickle into the pan. This, for a season, checks the escape
of the juices, and allows the meat to get warmed through
before the top dries by said escape. If there is much fat
upon the upper surface, cover with a paste of flour and
water until it is nearly done. Baste frequently, at first
with salt and water, afterward with the drippings. Allow
about a quarter of an hour to a pound, if you like your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
meat rare; more, if you prefer to have it well done.
Some, when the meat is almost done, dredge with flour
and baste with butter—only once.</p>

<p>Remove the beef, when quite ready, to a heated dish;
skim the drippings; add a teacupful of boiling water,
boil up once, and send to table in a gravy-boat. Many
reject made gravy altogether, and only serve the red
liquor that runs from the meat into the dish as it is cut.
This is the practice with some—indeed most of our best
housekeepers. If you have made gravy in a sauce-boat,
give your guest his choice between that and the juice in
the dish.</p>

<p>Serve with mustard, or scraped horse-radish and vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Set a piece of beef to roast upon a grating, or several
sticks laid across a dripping-pan. Three-quarters of an
hour before it is done, mix the pudding and pour into the
pan. Continue to roast the beef, the dripping meanwhile
falling upon the latter below. When both are done, cut
the pudding into squares, and lay around the meat when
dished. If there is much fat in the dripping-pan before
the pudding is ready to be put in, drain it off, leaving just
enough to prevent the batter from sticking to the bottom.</p>

<h4><i>Receipt for Pudding.</i></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>2 cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful, in mixing, not to get the batter too stiff.</p>

<p>This pudding, which the cook who introduced it into my
family persisted in calling “<i>Auction</i> pudding,” is very
palatable and popular, and not so rich as would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thought from the manner of baking. It should be a yellow-brown
when done.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef-Steak.</span></h3>

<p>It is not customary to fry beef-steaks for people who
know what really good cookery is. To speak more
plainly, a steak, <i>killed</i> by heat and swimming in grease,
is a culinary solecism, both vulgar and indigestible.</p>

<p>Cut the steak thick, at least three-quarters of an inch
in thickness, and if you cannot get tender meat for this
purpose, it is best to substitute some other dish for it.
But since tender meat is not always to be had, if the piece
you have purchased is doubtful, lay it on a clean cloth,
take a blunt heavy carving-knife, if you have not a steak
mallet, and hack <i>closely</i> from one end to the other; then
turn and repeat the process upon the other side. The
knife should be so dull you cannot cut with it, and the
strokes not the sixtieth part of an inch apart. Wipe all
over on both sides with <i>lemon-juice</i>, cover, and leave it in
a cool place for one hour. Lay on a buttered gridiron
over a clear fire, turning very often as it begins to drip.
Do not season until it is done, which will be in about
twelve minutes, if the fire is good and the cook attentive.
Rub your hot chafing dish with a split raw onion, lay in
the steak, salt and pepper on both sides, and put a liberal
lump of butter upon the upper. Then put on a hot cover,
and let it stand five minutes to draw the juices to the surface
before it is eaten. If you have neither chafing-dish
nor cover, lay the steak between two hot platters for the
same time, sending to table without uncovering. A gridiron
fitting <i>under</i> the grate is better than any other. If
a gridiron is not at hand, rub a little butter upon the
bottom of a hot, clean frying-pan, put in the meat, set
over a bright fire, and turn frequently. This will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
equal to steak cooked upon a gridiron, but it is infinitely
preferable to the same fried.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the wondering distrust with which
my first cook, a sable “professional,” watched me when I
undertook to show her how to prepare a steak for the
third breakfast over which I presided as mistress of ceremonies.
And when, at the end of twelve minutes, I
removed the meat, “rare and hot,” to the heated dish in
readiness, her sniff of lofty contempt was as eloquent as
indescribable.</p>

<p>“Call dat <i>cooked</i>! Folks ’bout here would ’a had dat
steak on by day-break!”</p>

<p>A remark that has been recalled to my mind hundreds
of times since at the tables of so-called capital housewives.</p>

<p>The best—nay, the only pieces for steak are those
known as porter-house and sirloin. The former is the
more highly esteemed by gourmands; but a really tender
sirloin is more serviceable where there are several persons
in the family, the porter-house having a narrow strip of
extremely nice meat lying next the bone, while the rest is
often inferior to any part of the sirloin. If the meat be
tender omit the hacking process and lemon-juice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef-steak and Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the steak as above directed. While it is broiling
put three or four chopped onions in a frying-pan with
a little beef-dripping or butter. Stir and shake them
briskly until they are done, and begin to brown. Dish
your steak and lay the onions thickly on top. Cover
and let all stand five or six minutes, that the hot onions may
impart the required flavor to the hot meat. In helping
your guests, inquire if they will take onions with the
slices of steak put upon their plates. I need hardly remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the sensible cook how necessary it is to withdraw
the gridiron from the fire for an instant, should the fat
drip upon the coals below, and smoke or blaze. Yet
those who have eaten steaks flavored with creosote may
thank me for the suggestion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef à-la-mode.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Take a round of beef; remove the bone from the middle,
and trim away the tougher bits about the edges, with
such gristle, &amp;c., as you can reach. Set these aside for
soup-stock.</p>

<p>Bind the beef into a symmetrical shape by passing a
strip of stout muslin, as wide as the round is high, about
it, and stitching the ends together at one side. Have
ready at least a pound of fat salt pork, cut into strips as
thick as your middle finger, and long enough to reach
from top to bottom of the trussed round. Put a half
pint of vinegar over the fire in a tin or porcelain saucepan;
season with three or four minced shallots or button
onions, two teaspoonfuls made mustard, a teaspoonful
nutmeg, one of cloves, half as much allspice, half-spoonful
black pepper, with a bunch of sweet herbs minced fine,
and a tablespoonful brown sugar. Let all simmer for five
minutes, then boil up once, and pour, while scalding hot,
upon the strips of pork, which should be laid in a deep
dish. Let all stand together until cold. Remove the
pork to a plate, and mix with the liquor left in the dish
enough bread-crumbs to make a tolerably stiff force-meat.
If the vinegar is very strong, dilute with a little water
before moistening the crumbs. With a long, thin-bladed
knife, make perpendicular incisions in the meat, not more
than half an inch apart, even nearer is better; thrust
into these the strips of fat pork, so far down that the
upper ends are just level with the surface, and work into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the cavities with them a little of the force-meat. Proceed
thus until the meat is fairly riddled and plugged with the
pork. Fill the hole from which the bone was taken with
the dressing and bits of pork; rub the upper side of the
beef well with the spiced force-meat. Put into a baking-pan;
half-fill this with boiling water; turn a large pan
over it to keep in the steam, and roast slowly for five or
six hours, allowing half an hour to each pound of meat.
If the beef be tough, you had better stew the round by
putting it in a pot with half enough cold water to cover
it. Cover tightly and stew very slowly for six hours;
then set in the oven with the gravy about it, and brown
half an hour, basting frequently.</p>

<p>If you roast the round, do not remove the cover, except
to baste (and this should be done often), until fifteen
minutes before you draw it from the oven. Set away
with the muslin band still about it, and pour the gravy
over the meat.</p>

<p>When cold, lift from the gravy,—which, by the way,
will be excellent seasoning for your soup-stock,—cut the
stitches in the muslin girdle, remove carefully and send
the meat to table, cold, garnished with parsley and nasturtium
blossoms. Carve horizontally, in slices thin as a
shaving. Do not offer the outside to any one; but the
second cut will be handsomely marbled with the white
pork, which appearance should continue all the way
down.</p>

<p>I cannot too highly commend this as a side-dish at
dinner, and a supper and breakfast stand-by. In winter
it will keep a week and more, and as long in summer, if
kept in the refrigerator—except when it is on the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfast Stew of Beef.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut up two pounds of beef—not too lean—into pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
an inch long; put them into a saucepan with just enough
water to cover them, and stew gently for two hours. Set
away until next morning, when season with pepper, salt,
sweet marjoram or summer savory, chopped onion, and
parsley. Stew half an hour longer, and add a teaspoonful
of sauce or catsup, and a tablespoonful of browned flour
wet up with cold water; finally, if you wish to have it
very good, half a glass of wine. Boil up once, and pour
into a covered deep dish.</p>

<p>This is an economical dish, for it can be made of the
commoner parts of the beef, and exceedingly nice for
winter breakfasts. Eaten with corn-bread and stewed
potatoes, it will soon win its way to a place in the “stock
company” of every judicious housewife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Another Breakfast Dish.</span></h3>

<p>Cut thin slices of cold roast beef, and lay them in a tin
saucepan set in a pot of boiling water. Cover them with
a gravy made of three tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
one of walnut catsup, a teaspoonful of vinegar, a little salt
and pepper, a spoonful of currant jelly, a teaspoonful made
mustard, and some warm water. Cover tightly, and steam
for half an hour, keeping the water in the outer vessel on
a hard boil.</p>

<p>If the meat is underdone, this is particularly nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Hash.</span></h3>

<p>To two parts cold roast or boiled corned beef, chopped
fine, put one of mashed potatoes, a little pepper, salt,
milk, and melted butter. Turn all into a frying-pan, and
stir until it is heated through and smoking hot, but not
until it browns. Put into a deep dish, and if stiff enough,
smooth as you would mashed potato, into a hillock.</p>

<p>Or, you can cease stirring for a few minutes, and let a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
brown crust form on the under side; then turn out
whole into a flat dish, the brown side uppermost.</p>

<p>Or, mould the mixture into flat cakes; dip these in
beaten egg flour, and fry in hot drippings.</p>

<p>The remains of beef <i>à-la-mode</i> are very good prepared
in any of these ways. A little catsup and mustard are an
improvement to plain cold beef, thus hashed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef-steak Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the steak into pieces an inch long, and stew with
the bone (cracked) in just enough water to cover the meat
until it is half-done. At the same time parboil a dozen
potatoes in another pot. If you wish a bottom crust—a
doubtful question—line a pudding-dish with a good paste,
made according to the receipt given below. Put in a
layer of the beef, with salt and pepper, and a very little
chopped onion; then one of sliced potatoes, with a little
butter scattered upon them, and so on, until the dish is
full. Pour over all the gravy in which the meat is
stewed, having first thrown away the bone and thickened
with browned flour. Cover with a crust thicker than the
lower, leaving a slit in the middle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crust for Meat-Pies.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of flour.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of lard.</li>
<li>2½ cups milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda wet with hot water, and stirred into the milk.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar sifted into the dry flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work up very lightly and quickly, and do not get too stiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>If you can get prepared flour, omit the soda and cream-tartar.</p>



<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Pie, with Potato Crust.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Mince some rare roast beef or cold corned beef, if it is
not too salt; season with pepper and salt, and spread a
layer in the bottom of a pudding-dish. Over this put one
of mashed potato, and stick bits of butter thickly all over
it; then another of meat, and so on until you are ready
for the crust.</p>

<p>To a large cupful of mashed potato add two tablespoonfuls
of melted butter, a well-beaten egg, two cups of
milk, and beat all together until very light. Then work
in enough flour to enable you to roll out in a sheet—not
too stiff—and, when you have added to the meat and
potato in the dish a gravy made of warm water, butter,
milk, and catsup, with what cold gravy or dripping remains
from “roast,” cover the pie with a thick, tender
crust, cutting a slit in the middle.</p>

<p>You can use the potato crust, which is very wholesome
and good, for any kind of meat-pie. It looks well brushed
over with beaten white of egg before it goes to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef’s Heart—Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the heart well, and cut into squares half an inch
long. Stew them for ten minutes in enough water to cover
them. Salt the water slightly to draw out the blood, and
throw it away as it rises in scum to the top. Take out the
meat, strain the liquor, and return the chopped heart to it,
with a sliced onion, a great spoonful of catsup, some parsley,
a head of celery chopped fine, and cayenne pepper,
with a large lump of butter. Stew until the meat is very
tender, when add a tablespoonful of browned flour to
thicken. Boil up once, and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Corn Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Rub each piece of beef well with salt mixed with one-tenth
part of saltpetre, until the salt lies dry upon the
surface. Put aside in a cold place for twenty-four hours,
and repeat the process, rubbing in the mixture very
thoroughly. Put away again until the next day, by
which time the pickle should be ready.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>5 gallons of water.</li>
<li>1 gallon of salt.</li>
<li>4 ounces saltpetre.</li>
<li>1½ lb. brown sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p class='unindent'>Boil this brine ten minutes; let it get perfectly cold; then
pour over the beef, having wiped the latter entirely dry.</p>

<p>Examine the pickle from time to time to see if it keeps
well; if not, take out the meat without delay, wipe it, and
rub in dry salt, covering it well until you can prepare
new and stronger brine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>If your piece is a round, skewer it well into shape, and
tie it up with stout tape or twine when you have washed it
in three or four waters and removed all the salt from the
outside. Put into a pot, and cover with cold water. Allow,
in boiling, about twenty minutes to a pound. Turn
the meat three times while cooking.</p>

<p>When done, drain very dry, and serve with drawn butter
in a sauce-boat. Send around mashed turnips with
the meat. They should be boiled in a separate pot, however,
or they will impart a disagreeable taste to the beef.</p>

<p>The brisket is a good piece for a family dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Tongue.</span></h3>

<p>Soak over night in cold water when you have washed
it well. Next morning put into a pot with plenty of cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
water, and boil slowly until it is tender throughout. This
you can determine by testing it with a fork. Leave in
the liquor until quite cold.</p>

<p>Pare off the thick skin, cut in round slices, and dish
for tea, garnishing with fresh parsley.</p>

<p>Tongue sandwiches are generally held in higher esteem
than those made of ham.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dried Beef.</span></h3>

<p>The most common way of serving dried or smoked
beef is to shave it into thin slices or chips, raw; but a
more savory relish may be made of it with little trouble.</p>

<p>Put the slices of uncooked beef into a frying-pan with
just enough boiling water to cover them; set them over
the fire for ten minutes, drain off all the water, and with
a knife and fork cut the meat into small bits. Return to
the pan, which should be hot, with a tablespoonful of butter
and a little pepper. Have ready some well-beaten
eggs, allowing four to a half-pound of beef; stir them
into the pan with the minced meat, and toss and stir the
mixture for about two minutes. Send to table in a
covered dish.</p>



<h3>MUTTON AND LAMB.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>The parts which are usually roasted are:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>The shoulder,</li>
<li>The saddle, or chine, and</li>
<li>The loin and haunch (a leg and part of the loin).</li>
</ul>

<p>The leg is best boiled, unless the mutton is young and
very tender. To roast—wash the meat well, and dry with
a clean cloth. Let your fire be clear and strong; put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
meat on with a little water in the dripping-pan. If you
think well of the plan (and I do), let there be a cupful of
boiling water dashed over the meat when it is first put
down to roast, and left to trickle into the pan. I have elsewhere
explained the advantages of the method. Allow, in
roasting, about twelve minutes per pound, if the fire is
good. Baste often—at first with salt and water, afterward
with the gravy. If it is in danger of browning too fast,
cover with a large sheet of white paper. Roast lamb in
the same manner, but not so long. Skim the gravy well,
and thicken very slightly with browned flour. Serve with
currant jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Mutton</span> <i>à la Venison</i>.</h3>

<p>A Christmas saddle of mutton is very fine prepared as
follows: Wash it well, inside and out, with vinegar. Do
not wipe it, but hang it up to dry in a cool cellar. When
the vinegar has dried off, throw a clean cloth over it, to
keep out the dust. On the next day but one, take down
the meat and sponge it over again with vinegar, then put
it back in its place in the cellar. Repeat this process
three times a week for a fortnight, keeping the meat hung
in a cold place, and covered, except while you are washing
it. When you are ready to cook it, wipe it off with a dry
cloth, but do not wash it. Roast—basting for the first
hour with butter and water; afterward with the gravy,
and keeping the meat covered with a large tin pan for two
hours. A large saddle of mutton will require four hours
to roast. When it is done, remove to a dish, and cover
to keep it hot. Skim the gravy, and add half a teacupful
of walnut, mushroom or tomato catsup, a glass of Madeira
wine, and a tablespoonful of browned flour. Boil
up once, and send to table in a sauce-boat. Always send
around currant or some other tart jelly with roast mutton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
If properly cooked, a saddle of mutton, prepared in accordance
with these directions, will strongly resemble
venison in taste. An old Virginia gentleman whom I
used to know, always hung up the finest saddle his plantation
could furnish <i>six weeks</i> before Christmas, and had it
sponged off with vinegar every other day, until the
morning of the important 25th; and the excellence of his
mutton was the talk of the neighborhood. It can
certainly be kept a fortnight anywhere at that season.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a leg of mutton clean, and wipe dry. Do not
leave the knuckle and shank so long as to be unshapely.
Put into a pot with hot water (salted) enough to cover it,
and boil until you ascertain, by probing with a fork, that
it is tender in the thickest part. Skim off all the scum as
it rises. Allow <i>about</i> twelve minutes to each pound. Take
from the fire, drain perfectly dry, and serve with melted
butter, with capers, or nasturtium seed; or, if you have
neither of these, some cucumber or gherkin-pickle stirred
into it. If you wish to use the broth for soup, put in
very little salt while boiling; if not, salt well, and boil
the meat in a cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Stew.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut up from three to four pounds of mutton,—the inferior
portions will do as well as any other,—crack the
bones, and remove all the fat. Put on the meat—the
pieces not more than an inch and a half in length—in a
pot with enough cold water to cover well, and set it where
it will heat gradually. Add nothing else until it has
stewed an hour, closely covered; then throw in half a
pound of salt pork cut into strips, a little chopped onion,
and some pepper; cover and stew an hour longer, or until
the meat is very tender. Make out a little paste, as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the crust of a meat-pie; cut into squares, and drop in the
stew. Boil ten minutes, and season further by the addition
of a little parsley and thyme. Thicken with two
spoonfuls of flour stirred into a cup of cold milk. Boil
up once, and serve in a tureen or deep covered dish.</p>

<p>If green corn is in season, this stew is greatly improved
by adding, an hour before it is taken from the fire, the
grains of half a dozen ears, cut from the cob.</p>

<p>Try it for a cheap family dinner, and you will repeat
the experiment often. Lamb is even better for your purpose
than mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>If your butcher has not done it,—and the chances are
that he has not, unless you stood by to see it attended to,—trim
off the superfluous fat and skin, so as to give the
chops a certain litheness and elegance of shape. Dip each
in beaten egg, roll in pounded cracker, and fry in hot lard
or dripping. If the fat is unsalted, sprinkle the chops
with salt before rolling in the egg. Serve up dry and hot.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may omit the egg and cracker, and broil on a gridiron
over a bright fire. Put a little salt and pepper upon
each chop, and butter them before they go to table. Cook
lamb chops in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Cutlets.</span> (<i>Baked</i>).</h3>

<p>Cut them from the neck, and trim neatly. Lay aside
the bits of bone and meat you cut off, to make gravy.
Pour a little melted butter over the cutlets, and let them
lie in it for fifteen minutes, keeping them just warm enough
to prevent the butter from hardening; then dip each in
beaten egg, roll in cracker-crumbs, and lay them in your
dripping-pan with a <i>very</i> little water at the bottom. Bake
quickly, and baste often with butter and water. Put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the bones, etc., in enough cold water to cover them; stew,
and season with sweet herbs, pepper, and salt, with a spoonful
of tomato catsup. Strain when all the substance is
extracted from the meat and bones; thicken with browned
flour, and pour over the cutlets when they are served.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Ham.</span></h3>

<p>For a leg of mutton weighing 12 lbs., take—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 ounce of black pepper, or ½ ounce of cayenne,</li>
<li>¼ lb. brown sugar,</li>
<li>1 ounce saltpetre,</li>
<li>1¼ lb. salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The day after the sheep is killed, mix the sugar, pepper,
and saltpetre, and rub well into the meat for nearly fifteen
minutes, until the outer part of it is thoroughly impregnated
with the seasoning. Put the ham into a large earthenware
vessel, and cover it with the salt. Let it remain
thus for three weeks, turning it every day and basting it
with the brine; adding to this, after the first week, a teacupful
of vinegar. When the ham is removed from the
pickle, wash with cold water, then with vinegar, and hang
it up in a cool cellar for a week, at least, before it is used.</p>

<p>Soak an hour in fair water before boiling.</p>

<p>Or if you choose to smoke it for several days after it is
corned, it can be chipped and eaten raw, like jerked venison
or dried beef.</p>

<p>Most of the receipts above given will apply as well to
lamb as to mutton. There are several exceptions, however,
which you will do well to note. Lamb should never be
boiled except in stews. It is tasteless and sodden cooked
in this manner, on account of its immaturity. But, on the
other hand, a lamb-pie, prepared like one of beef or venison,
is excellent, while mutton-pies have usually a strong,
tallowy taste, that spoils them for delicate palates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Roast lamb should be eaten with mint sauce (if you
fancy it), currant jelly, and asparagus or green peas. Lettuce-salad
is likewise a desirable accompaniment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton or Lamb Réchauffé.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut some slices of cold underdone mutton or lamb; put
them in a frying-pan with enough gravy or broth to cover
them. Or, if you have neither of them, make a gravy of
butter, warm water, and catsup. Heat to boiling, and stir
in pepper and a great spoonful of currant jelly. Send to
table in a chafing-dish, with the gravy poured about the
meat.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can put a lump of the butter in the bottom of the
pan, and when it boils, lay in the slices of meat, turning
them before they have time to crisp. As soon as they are
thoroughly heated take them out, lay upon a hot dish,
sprinkle with pepper and salt, and serve with a small
spoonful of jelly laid upon each.</p>



<h3>VEAL.</h3>

<p>Despite the prejudice, secret or expressed, which prevails
in many minds against veal,—one which the wise and witty
“Country Parson” has as surely fostered among reading
people, as did Charles Lamb the partiality for roast pig,—the
excellent and attractive dishes that own this as their
base are almost beyond number. For soups it is invaluable,
and in <i>entrees</i> and <i>réchauffés</i> it plays a distinguished
part. From his head to his feet, the animal that
furnishes us with this important element of success in
what should be the prime object of cookery, to wit, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
please while we nourish, has proved himself so useful as
an ally that it behooves us to lift the stigma from the
name of “calf,” provided he be not <i>too</i> infantine. In that
case he degenerates into an insipid mass of pulpy muscle
and gelatine, and deserves the bitterest sneers that have
been flung at his kind.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Veal.</span></h3>


<h4>LOIN.</h4>

<p>Veal requires a longer time to roast than mutton or
lamb. It is fair to allow <i>at least</i> a quarter of an hour to
each pound. Heat gradually, baste frequently—at first
with salt and water, afterward with gravy. When the
meat is nearly done, dredge lightly with flour, and baste
once with melted butter. Skim the gravy; thicken with
a tablespoonful of flour, boil up, and put into the gravy-boat.</p>

<p>Should the meat brown too fast, cover with white
paper. The juices, which make up the characteristic
flavor of meat, are oftener dried out of veal than any
other flesh that comes to our tables.</p>


<h4>BREAST.</h4>

<p>Make incisions between the ribs and the meat, and fill
with a force-meat made of fine bread-crumbs, bits of pork,
or ham chopped “exceeding small,” salt, pepper, thyme,
sweet marjoram, and beaten egg. Save a little to thicken
the gravy. Roast slowly, basting often, and the verdict
of the eaters will differ from theirs who pronounce this
the coarsest part of the veal. Dredge, at the last, with
flour, and baste well once with butter, as with the loin.</p>


<h4>FILLET.</h4>

<p>Make ready a dressing of bread-crumbs, chopped thyme
and parsley; a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
together with some melted butter or beef suet; moisten
with milk or hot water, and bind with a beaten egg.</p>

<p>Take out the bone from the meat, and pin securely into
a round with skewers; then pass a stout twine several
times about the fillet, or a band of muslin. Fill the
cavity from which the bone was taken with this stuffing,
and thrust between the folds of the meat, besides making
incisions with a thin, sharp knife to receive it. Once in a
while slip in a strip of fat pork or ham. Baste at first
with salt and water, afterward with gravy. At the last,
dredge with flour and baste with butter.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER.</h4>

<p>Stuff as above, making horizontal incisions near the
bone to receive the dressing, and roast in like manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>Dip in beaten egg when you have sprinkled a little
pepper and salt over them; then roll in cracker-crumbs,
and fry in hot dripping or lard. If you use butter or
dripping, add a little boiling water to the gravy when the
meat is dished; thicken with browned flour, boil up
once, sending to table in a boat.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can rub the cutlets well with melted butter, pepper,
and broil on a gridiron like beef-steak, buttering <i>very</i> well
after dishing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Chops</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are more juicy and less apt to be tough and solid than cutlets.
Trim the bone as with mutton chops, and fry, dipping
in beaten egg and cracker-crumbs. Add a little
parsley and a minced shallot to the gravy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Steak.</span></h3>

<p>This should be thinner than beef-steak, and be done
throughout. Few persons are fond of rare veal. Broil
upon a well-greased gridiron over a clear fire, and turn
frequently while the steaks are cooking. Put into a saucepan
four or five young onions minced fine, a great teaspoonful
of tomato catsup, or twice the quantity of stewed
tomato, a lump of butter the size of an egg, and a little
thyme or parsley, with a small teacupful of hot water.
Let them stew together while the steaks are broiling,
thickening, before you turn the gravy out, with a spoonful
of browned flour. Add, if you please, a half-glass of
wine. Boil up once hard, and when the steaks are dished,
with a small bit of butter upon each, pour the mixture
over and around them.</p>

<p>Spinach is as natural an accompaniment to veal as are
green peas to lamb.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Pies.</span></h3>

<p>Let your veal be juicy and not too fat. Take out all
the bone, and put with the fat and refuse bits, such as skin
or gristle, in a saucepan, with a large teacupful of cold
water to make gravy. Instead of chopping the veal, cut
in thin, even slices. Line a pudding-dish with a good
paste and put a layer of veal in the bottom; then
one of hard-boiled eggs sliced, each piece buttered and
peppered before it is laid upon the veal; cover these with
sliced ham or thin strips of salt pork. Squeeze a few drops
of lemon-juice upon the ham. Then another layer of veal,
and so on until you are ready for the gravy. This should
have been stewing for half an hour or so, with the addition
of pepper and a bunch of aromatic herbs. Strain through
a thin cloth and pour over the pie. Cover with crust and
bake two hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Butter a large bowl very thickly, and line with sliced hard-boiled
eggs. Then put in, in perpendicular layers, a lining
of veal cut in thin slices, and seasoned with pepper. Next,
one of sliced ham, each slice peppered and sprinkled with
lemon-juice, more veal and more ham, until the dish is
packed to the brim. Cover with a thick paste made of
flour and hot water, just stiff enough to handle with ease.
Press this closely to the outside of the bowl, which should
not be at all greasy. Let it overlap the rim about half an
inch. Some cooks substitute a cloth well floured, but it
does not keep in the essence of the meats as well as the
paste. Set the bowl in a pot of hot water, not so deep
that it will bubble over the top. It is better that it should
not touch the paste rim. Boil steadily—not hard—for at
least three hours. Remove the paste the next day, when
bowl and contents are perfectly cold, and turn out the pie
into a large plate or flat dish. Cut in circular slices—thin
as a wafer—beginning at the top, keeping your carver
horizontal, and you have a delicious relish for the supper-table,
or side-dish for dinner. Set in a cool place, and in
winter it will keep several days.</p>

<p>This is the “weal and hammer pie” endorsed by Mr.
Wegg as a good thing “for mellering the organ,” and is a
great favorite in England. It is a good plan to butter the
eggs as well as the dish, as much of the success of the pie
depends upon the manner in which it is turned out. Also,
upon the close packing of the sliced meat. The salt ham
prevents the need of other salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Fillet of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Stuff, and bind with twine as for roasting. Then cover
the top and sides with sliced ham which has been already
boiled, securing with skewers, or twine crossing the meat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
all directions. Lay in a pot, put in two large cups of
boiling water, cover immediately and closely, and stew
gently—never letting it cease to boil, yet never boiling
hard, for four or five hours. A large fillet will require
nearly five hours. Remove the cover as seldom as possible,
and only to ascertain whether the water has boiled
away. If it is too low, replenish from the boiling kettle.
Take off the strings when the meat is done; arrange the
ham about the fillet in the dish, and serve a bit with each
slice of veal. Strain the gravy, thicken with flour, boil
up once, and send in a boat.</p>

<p>Serve with stewed tomatoes and spinach.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Knuckle of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Put the meat into a pot with two quarts of boiling
water, half a pound of salt pork or ham cut into strips, a
carrot, two onions, a bunch of parsley and one of summer
savory—all cut fine—two dozen whole pepper-corns, and
stew, closely covered, for three hours. When done, take
the meat from the pot and lay in the dish. Strain the
gravy, thicken with rice-flour, boil up once, and pour over
the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Scallop.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Chop some cold roast or stewed veal very fine, put a layer
in the bottom of a buttered pudding dish, and season with
pepper and salt. Next have a layer of finely powdered
crackers. Strew some bits of butter upon it and wet with
a little milk; then more veal seasoned as before, and
another round of cracker-crumbs, with butter and milk.
When the dish is full, wet well with gravy or broth, diluted
with warm water. Spread over all a thick layer of
cracker seasoned with salt, wet into a paste with milk and
bound with a beaten egg or two, if the dish be large.
Stick butter-bits thickly over it; invert a tin pan so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cover all and keep in the steam, and bake—if small, half
an hour; three-quarters will suffice for a large dish. Remove
the cover ten minutes before it is served, and brown.</p>

<p>This simple and economical dish should be an acquaintance
with all who are fond of veal in any shape. Children
generally like it exceedingly, and I have heard more than
one gentleman of excellent judgment in culinary affairs
declare that the best thing he knew about roast veal was
that it was the harbinger of scallop on the second day.</p>

<p>Try it, and do not get it too dry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Pâtés.</span></h3>

<p>Mince the veal as above, and roll three or four crackers
to powder. Also, chop up some cold ham and mix with
the veal in the proportion of one-third ham and two-thirds
veal. Then add the cracker, and wet well with
gravy and a little milk. If you have no gravy, stir into
a cup of hot milk two tablespoonfuls of butter and a
beaten egg. Season well to your taste, and bake in pâté
pans lined with puff-paste. If eaten hot, send to table
in the tins. If cold, slip the pâtés out and pile upon
a plate, with sprigs of parsley between. A little oyster
liquor is a marked improvement to the gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Calf’s-Head.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the head in several waters, and taking out the
brains, set them by in a cool place. Tie the head in a
floured cloth and boil it two hours in hot water slightly
salted. Wash the brains carefully, picking out all the bits
of skin and membrane, cleansing them over and over until
they are perfectly white. Then stew in just enough water
to cover them. Take them out, mash smooth with the
back of a wooden spoon, and add gradually, that it may
not lump, a small teacupful of the water in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
head is boiled. Season with chopped parsley, a pinch of
sage, pepper, salt, and powdered cloves, with a great spoonful
of butter. Set it over the fire to simmer in a saucepan
until you are ready. When the head is tender, take it up
and drain very dry. Score the top, and rub it well over
with melted butter; dredge with flour and set in the oven
to brown. Or, you can use beaten egg and cracker-crumbs
in place of the butter and flour.</p>

<p>When you serve the head, pour the gravy over it.</p>

<p>Never skin a calf’s-head. Scald as you would that of a
pig. A little lye in the water will remove the hair—as
will also pounded rosin, applied before it is put into the
water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s-Head</span> (<i>Scalloped.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean the head, remove the brains, and set in a cool
place. Boil the head until the meat slips easily from the
bones. Take it out and chop fine, season with herbs, pepper,
and salt; then put in layers into a buttered pudding-dish
with bits of butter between each layer. Moisten well
with the liquor in which the head was boiled. Wash the
brains very thoroughly, removing all the membrane. Beat
them into a smooth paste, season with pepper and salt,
and stir in with them two eggs beaten very light.
Spread this evenly over the scallop, dredge the top with
a little flour, and bake to a delicate brown. Half an hour
will be long enough.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet-Breads</span> (<i>Fried.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Wash very carefully, and dry with a linen cloth. Lard
with narrow strips of fat salt pork, set closely together.
Use for this purpose a larding-needle. Lay the sweet-breads
in a clean, hot frying-pan, which has been well
buttered or greased, and cook to a fine brown, turning
frequently until the pork is crisp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Breads</span> (<i>Broiled.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Parboil, rub them well with butter, and broil on a clean
gridiron. Turn frequently, and now and then roll over in
a plate containing some hot melted butter. This will prevent
them from getting too dry and hard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet-Breads</span> (<i>Stewed.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>When you have washed them, and removed all bits of
skin and fatty matter, cover with cold water, and heat to
a boil. Pour off the hot water, and cover with cold until
the sweet-breads are firm. If you desire to have them
very rich, lard as for frying before you put in the second
water. They are more delicate, however, if the pork be
left out. Stew in a very little water the second time.
When they are tender, add for each sweet-bread a heaping
teaspoonful of butter, and a little chopped parsley,
with pepper, and salt, and a little cream. Let them simmer
in this gravy for five minutes, then take them up.
Send to table in a covered dish, with the gravy poured
over them.</p>

<p>If you lard the sweet-breads, substitute for the cream in
the gravy a glass of good wine. In this case, take the
sweet-breads out before it is put into the gravy. Boil up
once and pour over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet-Breads</span> (<i>Roasted.</i>)</h3>

<p>Parboil and throw into cold water, where let them
stand for fifteen minutes. Then change to more cold water
for five minutes longer. Wipe perfectly dry. Lay them
in your dripping-pan, and roast, basting with butter and
water until they begin to brown. Then withdraw them
for an instant, roll in beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs,
and return to the fire for ten minutes longer, basting
meanwhile twice with melted butter. Lay in a chafing-dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
while you add to the dripping half a cup hot water,
some chopped parsley, a teaspoonful browned flour, and
the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the sweet-breads before
sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jellied Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a knuckle of veal, and cut it into three pieces.
Boil it slowly until the meat will slip easily from the
bones; take out of the liquor; remove all the bones, and
chop the meat fine. Season with salt, pepper, two shallots
chopped as fine as possible, mace and thyme, or, if you
like, sage. Put back into the liquor, and boil until it is
almost dry and can be stirred with difficulty. Turn into
a mould until next day. Set on the table cold, garnish
with parsley, and cut in slices. The juice of a lemon,
stirred in just before it is taken from the fire, is an improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s-Head in a Mould.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a calf’s-head until tender, the day before you wish
to use it. When perfectly cold, chop—not too small—and
season to taste with pepper, salt, mace, and the juice
of a lemon. Prepare half as much cold ham, fat and
lean—also minced—as you have of the chopped calf’s-head.
Butter a mould well, and lay in the bottom a
layer of the calf’s-head, then one of ham, and so on
until the shape is full, pressing each layer hard, when you
have moistened it with veal gravy or the liquor in which
the head was boiled. Pour more gravy over the top, and
when it has soaked in well, cover with a paste made of
flour and water. Bake one hour. Remove the paste
when it is quite cold, and turn out carefully. Cut perpendicularly.</p>

<p>This is quite as good a relish when made of cold roast
or stewed veal and ham. It will keep several days in
cool weather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Olives with Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Cut large, smooth slices from a fillet of veal, or veal
chops will do quite as well. Trim them into a uniform
shape and size, and spread each neatly with forced-meat
made of bread-crumbs and a little chopped pork, seasoned
with pepper and salt. Over this spread some chopped
oysters, about three to a good-sized slice of veal. Roll
them up carefully and closely, and pin each with two
small tin or wooden skewers. Lay them in a dripping-pan;
dash a teacupful of boiling water over them, and
roast, basting at least twice with melted butter. When
they are brown, remove to a chafing-dish, and cover,
while you add a little oyster-liquor to the gravy left in
the dripping-pan. Let this simmer for three or four
minutes; thicken with a teaspoonful of browned flour,
and boil up at once. Withdraw the skewers cautiously,
so as not to break the olives; pour the gravy over and
around them, and serve. If you have no skewers, bind
the olives with pack-thread, cutting it, of course, before
sending to table.</p>

<p>Serve with cranberry jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Take the remains of a cold roast of veal fillet, shoulder,
or breast, and cut all the meat from the bones. Put the
latter, with the outside slices and the gristly pieces, into a
saucepan, with a cup of cold water, some sweet herbs,
pepper, and salt. If you have a bit of bacon convenient,
or a ham-bone, add this and omit the salt. Stew all
together for an hour, then strain, thicken with flour, return
to the fire, and boil five minutes longer, stirring in a
tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, mince the cold veal, and when the gravy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ready put this in a little at a time. Let it <i>almost</i> boil,
when add two tablespoonfuls of cream, or three of milk,
stirring all the while. Lastly, squeeze in the juice of a
lemon, and a moment later half a glass of Sherry or Madeira
wine.</p>

<p>The mince-meat should be dry enough to heap into a
shape in a flat dish or chafing-dish. Lay triangles of buttered
toast about the base of the mound, and on the top a
poached egg.</p>

<p>The remains of cold roast beef treated in this manner,
substituting for the toast balls of mashed potato, will
make a neat and palatable dish.</p>

<p>Send around spinach or stewed tomatoes with minced
veal; scraped horseradish steeped in vinegar with the beef.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets à la Maintenon.</span></h3>

<p>The cutlets should be nearly three-quarters of an inch
thick, and trim in shape. Dip each in beaten egg, then
into pounded cracker which has been seasoned with powdered
sweet herbs, pepper, and salt. Wrap each cutlet in
a half-sheet of note or letter paper, well buttered; lay them
upon a buttered gridiron and broil over a clear fire, turning
often and dexterously. You can secure the papers by
fringing the ends, and twisting these after the cutlets are
put in. This is neater than to pin them together. In trying
this dish for the first time, have ready a sufficient number
of duplicate papers in a clean, hot dish. If your envelopes
are much soiled or darkened while the cutlets are
broiling, transfer quickly when done to the clean warm
ones, twist the ends, and serve. Cutlets prepared in this
manner are sent to table in their cloaks, ranged symmetrically
upon a hot chafing-dish.</p>

<p>The expedient of the clean papers is a “trick of the
trade,” amateur housewives will observe with satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Epicures profess to enjoy veal cooked in covers far more
than when the flavor and juices escape in broiling without
them. Empty every drop of gravy from the soiled
papers into the clean over the cutlets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Croquettes of Calf’s Brains.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the brains very thoroughly until they are free
from membranous matter and perfectly white. Beat them
smooth; season with a pinch of powdered sage, pepper,
and salt. Add two tablespoonfuls fine bread-crumbs
moistened with milk, and a beaten egg. Roll into balls
with floured hands, dip in beaten egg, then cracker-crumbs,
and fry in butter or veal-drippings.</p>

<p>These make a pleasant accompaniment to boiled
spinach. Heap the vegetable in the centre of the dish,
arrange the balls about it, and give one to each person
who wishes spinach.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> (<i>Roasted.</i>)</h3>

<p>Soak the liver in salt and water an hour to draw out the
blood. Wipe perfectly dry, and stuff with a force-meat
made of bread-crumbs, two slices of fat salt pork, chopped
small, a shallot, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; sweet marjoram
and thyme, and if you choose, a little sage. Moisten this
with butter melted in a very little hot water, and two raw
eggs, well beaten. In order to get this into the liver, make
an incision with a narrow sharp knife, and without enlarging
the aperture where the blade entered, move the
point dexterously to and fro, to enlarge the cavity inside.
Stuff this full of the force-meat, sew or skewer up the outer
orifice; lard with strips of salt pork, and roast for an hour,
basting twice with butter and water, afterward with the
gravy in the dripping-pan. Pour the gravy over the liver
when done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Roasted liver is very good cold, cut into slices like
tongue.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> (<i>Fried</i>).</h3>

<p>Slice the liver smoothly, and lay in salt and water to
draw out the blood. Lard each slice, when you have wiped
it dry, with slices of fat salt pork, drawn through at regular
distances, and projecting slightly on each side. Lay
in a clean frying-pan and fry brown. When done, take
out the slices, arrange them neatly on a hot dish, and set
aside to keep warm. Add to the gravy in the frying-pan
a chopped onion, a half-cup of hot water, pepper, the juice
of a lemon, and thicken with brown flour. Boil up well,
run through a cullender to remove the onion and the bits
of crisped pork that may have been broken off in cooking,
pour over the liver, and serve hot.</p>

<p>Pigs’ livers can be cooked in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> (<i>Stewed</i>).</h3>

<p>Slice the liver and lay in salt and water an hour.
Then cut into dice and put over the fire, with enough cold
water to cover it well. Cover and stew steadily for an
hour, when add salt, pepper, a little mace, sweet marjoram,
parsley, and a teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce. Stew
again steadily, not fast, for half an hour longer, when put
in a tablespoonful of butter, two of browned flour—wet with
cold water, a teaspoonful of lemon-juice and one of
currant jelly. Boil five minutes longer, and dish. A
little wine is an improvement.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Put in with the liver-dice some of salt pork—say a handful—and
when you season, a chopped onion, and omit the
jelly at the last, substituting some tomato catsup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitation Pâtés de Foie Gras.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil a calf’s liver until very tender in water that has
been slightly salted, and in another vessel a nice calf’s
tongue. It is best to do this the day before you make
your <i>pâté</i>, as they should be not only cold, but firm when
used. Cut the liver into bits, and rub these gradually to
a smooth paste in a Wedgewood mortar, moistening, as
you go on, with melted butter. Work into this paste,
which should be quite soft, a quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne
pepper, or twice the quantity of white or black, half a
grated nutmeg, a little cloves, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce, salt to taste, a full teaspoonful of made mustard,
and a tablespoonful of boiling water, in which a
minced onion has been steeped until the flavor is extracted.
Work all together thoroughly, and pack in jelly-jars with
air-tight covers, or, if you have them, in <i>pâté</i>-jars. They
give a foreign air to the compound, and aid imagination
in deceiving the palate. Butter the inside of the jars well,
and pack the <i>pâté</i> very hard, inserting here and there
square and triangular bits of the tongue, which should be
pared and cut up for this purpose. These simulate the
truffles imbedded in the genuine <i>pâtés</i> from Strasbourg.
When the jar is packed, and smooth as marble on the
surface, cover with melted butter. Let this harden, put
on the lid, and set away in a cool place. In winter it will
keep for weeks, and is very nice for luncheon or tea.
Make into sandwiches, or set on in the jars, if they are
neat and ornamental.</p>

<p>The resemblance in taste to the real <i>pâté de foie gras</i> is
remarkable, and the domestic article is popular with the
lovers of that delicacy. Pigs’ livers make a very fair
<i>pâté</i>. If you can procure the livers of several fowls and
treat as above, substituting bits of the inside of the gizzard
for truffles, you will find the result even more satisfactory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Marble.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a beef-tongue the day before it is to be used, and a
like number of pounds of lean veal. Grind first one,
then the other, in a sausage-cutter, keeping them in
separate vessels until you are ready to pack. If you have
no machine for this purpose, chop <i>very</i> fine. Season the
tongue with pepper, powdered sweet herbs, a teaspoonful
of made mustard, a little nutmeg, and cloves—just a pinch
of each; the veal in like manner, with the addition of
salt. Pack in alternate spoonfuls, as irregularly as possible,
in cups, bowls, or jars, which have been well buttered.
Press very hard as you go on, smooth the top, and cover
with melted butter. When this cools, close the cans, and
keep in a cool, dry place. Turn out whole, or cut in slices
for tea. It is a pretty and savory relish, garnished with
parsley or the blanched tops of celery.</p>

<p>You can use ground ham instead of tongue. It is
hardly so good, but is more economical.</p>



<h3>PORK.</h3>

<p>At the South, where, in spite of the warm climate, the
consumption of pork is double that of the North, the full-grown
hog is seldom represented by any of his parts at
the table, fresh or pickled, unless it be during killing-time,
when fresh spare-ribs, chine, and steak, with other
succulent bits, are welcome upon the choicest bills of fare.
The rest of the animal—ham, shoulders, and middlings—is
consigned to the packing barrel, and ultimately to the
smoke-house. But, in cool weather, “shoat”—<i>i. e.</i>, pig
under six months of age—is abundantly displayed in market,
and highly esteemed by all classes. The meat is fine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sweet, and, unless too fat, nearly as delicate as that of
chicken—a very different-looking and tasting dish from
the gross oleaginous joints and “chunks” offered for sale
in many other regions as “nice young pork.” Those of
my readers who can command “shoat” are to be heartily
congratulated. Those whose butchers dispense only portions
of the mature porker will do well, in my opinion, if
they rarely admit him to their families before he has been
salted, and been thereby purged of many unwholesome
properties. Few stomachs, save those of out-door
laborers, can digest the fresh meat of a two or three, or
even one year old hog. This is the truthful, but, to unaccustomed
ears, offensive name for him at the South and
West, where his qualities and habits are best known.</p>

<p>The parts of a properly dissected hog are the hams,
shoulders, griskin or chine, the loin, middlings, spare-ribs,
head, feet, liver, and haslet. The choice portions are hams,
shoulders, and, for roasting, the loin. All hogs should be
kept up and well fed for three weeks, at least, before they
are killed; their styes be frequently cleaned, and furnished
with abundance of water, renewed every day. Sir Grunter
would be a more cleanly creature if he were allowed more
extensive water privileges. If it were possible—and in
the country this may sometimes be done—to build his pen
on the bank of a running stream, he would speedily redeem
his character from the stain cast upon it by the popular
verdict, and the superior quality of the meat repay the
thoughtful kindness of his owner. It is a disgrace to
humanity, hardly second to the barbarities of swill-milk
manufactories, this compulsory filth of any domestic animal.
Those who, like myself, have been loathing witnesses
of the pig-pens upon the premises of well-to-do farmers—the
receptacles of the vilest slops and offal, never cleaned
except during the yearly removal of manure from barnyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to field—cannot marvel at the growing prejudice
against pork in all its varieties that pervades our best
classes. We feed the hog with the offscourings (this is
literal) of house, garden, and table; bed him in mire, and
swell him with acetous fermentation, not to say active decomposition,
and then abuse him for being what we have
made him. I am persuaded—and wiser people than I declare—that
hog-scrofula and cholera, and the rest of the
train of fleshly ills that are the terror of pork-raisers, have,
one and all, their root in this unseemly inhumanity.
Eschew fresh pork we may, but we cannot dispense with
hams, shoulders, and, most valuable of all to the cook, lard
and pickled pork. Real sausage, porcine and home-made,
is still sweet and pleasant to the unpampered palate; and
of roast pig, the gentlest and most genial of English essayists
did not disdain to become the eulogist. In memory of
his usefulness, in belief of the healthfulness which should
be his birthright, and the safeguard of his consumers, let
us treat Bristle well—I do not say philosophically, but
sensibly and kindly.</p>

<p>A pig should not be allowed to eat anything for twenty-four
hours before he is killed. After he is butchered,
great care should be exercised to keep the pork from tainting;
it spoils more readily, when fresh, than any other
meat. Cook all kinds of pork thoroughly. When underdone
it is not only unpalatable, but exceedingly unwholesome.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Leg of Pork.</span></h3>

<p>One weighing about seven pounds is enough, even for a
large family. If the pig be young, the leg will be even
smaller. Score the skin in squares, or parallel lines running
from side to side, for the convenience of the carver.
Put it down to roast with a <i>very</i> little water in the pan below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Heat gradually until the fat begins to ooze from the
meat, when quicken the fire to a red, steady glow. Baste
only with its own gravy, and do this often, that the skin
may not be hard or tough. When done take it up, skim
the gravy thoroughly, put in half a cup of boiling water,
thicken with brown flour, add pepper, salt, and the juice
of a lemon, and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If the joint be that of a full-grown hog, rub into the top,
after scoring it deeply, a force-meat of bread-crumbs
seasoned with sage and chopped onion, wet with the juice
of a lemon or a very little vinegar; pepper and salt to
taste. Rub this in hard until the cracks are filled. With
a sharp knife make incisions close to the knuckle-bone, and
stuff with the force-meat, tying a string tightly about it
afterward, to prevent the escape of the seasoning. Rub
over once with butter, when the meat is warm throughout;
then baste with the fat. Skim all the fat from the drippings
that can be removed before making the gravy.</p>

<p>Send around tomato or apple sauce, and pickles, with
roast pork.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Loin of Pork.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as you would a leg, allowing twenty minutes to a
pound in roasting. This is a good rule for fresh pork, the
flesh being coarser and of closer grain than are more
delicate meats.</p>

<p>A shoulder is roasted in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Spare-Rib.</span></h3>

<p>When first put down to the fire, cover with a greased
paper until it is half-done. Remove it then, and dredge
with flour. A few minutes later, baste once with butter,
and afterward, every little while, with its own gravy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
This is necessary, the spare-rib being a very dry piece.
Just before you take it up, strew over the surface thickly
with fine bread-crumbs seasoned with powdered sage,
pepper, and salt, and a small onion minced into almost
invisible bits. Let it cook five minutes and baste once
more with butter. Skim the gravy, add a half cupful of
hot water, thicken with brown flour, squeeze in the juice
of a lemon, strain, and pour over the meat in the dish.</p>

<p>Send tomato catsup around with it, or if you prefer, put
a liberal spoonful in the gravy, after it is strained.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chine.</span></h3>

<p>A chine is treated precisely as is the spare-rib, except
that the strip of skin running along the back is scored
closely. If you wish, you can omit the bread-crumb
crust, the onion and sage. In carving, cut thin horizontal
slices from the ribs. Chine is best cold. The meat next
the ribs is delicious when scraped off and made into
sandwiches, or laid upon buttered toast.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can wash the chine over with beaten egg, dredge
with cracker-crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, and
roast, basting with butter and water once when the meat
is heated through, afterward with its own gravy. This is
a palatable supper-dish when cold. Garnish with cucumber
pickles cut in round slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Pig.</span></h3>

<p>A month-old pig, if it be well-grown and plump, is best
for this purpose. It is hardly possible that any lady-housekeeper
will ever be called upon to do the butcher’s
work upon the bodies of full-grown hogs, or even “shoat”—a
task that requires the use of hatchet or cleaver. It is
well that she should know how to clean and dress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
baby pig, which is not larger than a Thanksgiving
turkey.</p>

<p>As soon as it is really cold, make ready a large boiler of
scalding water. Lay the pig in cold water for fifteen
minutes; then, holding it by the hind-leg, plunge it into
the boiling water, and shake it about violently until you
can pull the hair off by the handful. Take it out, wipe it
dry, and with a crash cloth or whisk broom rub the hair
off, brushing from the tail to the head, until the skin is
perfectly clean. Cut it open, take out the entrails, and
wash very thoroughly with cold water, then with soda
and water, to remove any unpleasant odor; next with salt
and water. Rinse with fair water and wipe inside. Then
wrap in a wet cloth, and keep this saturated with cold
water until you are ready to stuff it. If these directions
be followed implicitly, the pig will be fair and white, as
if intrusted to a professional butcher.</p>

<p>For stuffing, take a cupful of bread-crumbs, half a
chopped onion, two teaspoonfuls powdered sage, three
tablespoonfuls melted butter, a saltspoonful of pepper, half
a grated nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of salt, two well-beaten
eggs. Mix all these ingredients, except the egg,
together, incorporating them well; beat in the eggs, and
stuff the pig into his natural size and shape. Sew him
up, and bend his fore-feet backward, his hind-feet forward,
under and close to the body, and skewering them into the
proper position. Dry it well, and dredge with flour. Put
it to roast with a little hot water, slightly salted, in the
dripping-pan. Baste with butter and water three times,
as the pig gradually warms, afterward with the dripping.
When it begins to smoke or steam, rub it over every five
minutes or so, with a cloth dipped in melted butter. Do
not omit this precaution if you would have the skin tender
and soft after it begins to brown. A month-old pig will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
require about an hour and three-quarters or two hours—sometimes
longer—to roast, if the fire be brisk and steady.</p>

<p>Should you or your guests dislike onion, prepare your
stuffing without it. The following is a good receipt for
rich and savory force-meat for a pig:—</p>

<p>One cup of bread-crumbs, an ounce of suet, a bunch
of parsley minced fine, teaspoonful of powdered sage,
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, a little thyme, half a glass Madeira
or Sherry, juice of a lemon, two tablespoonfuls melted
butter, a cup of oyster-liquor, and two well-beaten eggs.
For a Christmas pig, it is worth one’s while to take the
trouble to prepare this stuffing.</p>

<p>If your pig is large, you can cut off his head and split
him down the back before sending to table. Do this with
a sharp knife, and lay the backs together. But it is a pity!
I have before me now the vision of a pig I once saw served
whole on the table of a friend, that forbids me ever to
mutilate him before the guests have a chance to feast
their eyes upon the goodly picture. He was done to
a turn—a rich, even brown, without a seam or crack from
head to tail, and he knelt in a bed of deep-green parsley,
alternately with bunches of whitish-green celery tops (the
inner and tender leaves); a garland of the same was
about his neck, and in his mouth was a tuft of white
cauliflower, surrounded by a setting of curled parsley.
Very simple, you see; but I never beheld a more ornamental
roast.</p>

<p>Skim your gravy well; add a little hot water, thicken
with brown flour, boil up once, strain, and, when you have
added half a glass of wine and half the juice of a lemon,
serve in a tureen.</p>

<p>In carving the pig, cut off the head first; then split
down the back, take off hams and shoulders, and separate
the ribs. Serve some of the dressing to each person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been thus minute in describing the preparation
of this holiday dish, because it is erroneously considered
a difficult task. Any cook with a moderate degree of
judgment and experience can undertake it with a reasonable
expectation of success.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork Steaks.</span></h3>

<p>Those from the loin are best, but they can be cut from
the neck. Remove the skin and trim neatly. Broil over
a clear fire, without seasoning, adding pepper, salt, a pinch
of sage, another of minced onion, and a lump of butter
after they are put into the hot dish. Then cover closely
and set in the oven for five minutes, until the aroma of
the condiments flavors the meat. Try this method. You
can cook spare-rib in the same manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the skin, trim them, and dip first in beaten
egg, then in cracker-crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper,
minced onion, and a little sage. Fry in hot lard or drippings
twenty or thirty minutes, turning often. The gravy
of this dish is usually too rich or fat to accompany the
meat.</p>

<p>Pork cutlets are cooked in like manner. Send apple-sauce
to the table with them, and season with tomato catsup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pork.</span></h3>

<p>Take some lean slices from the leg, or bits left from
trimming the various pieces into shape. Cut into dice an
inch square, put into a pot with enough cold water to
cover them, and stew gently for three-quarters of an
hour, closely covered. Meanwhile parboil half a dozen
Irish potatoes, cut in thick slices, in another vessel. When
the pork has stewed the allotted time, drain off the water
from these and add to the meat. Season with pepper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
salt, a minced shallot, a spoonful of pungent catsup, and
a bunch of aromatic herbs. Cover again, and stew twenty
minutes longer, or until the meat is tender throughout.</p>

<p>If your meat be not too fat, this stew will be very good,
especially on a cold day.</p>

<p>You can stew cutlets in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pig’s Head</span> (<i>Roasted</i>).</h3>

<p>Take the head of a half-grown pig; clean and split it,
taking out the brains and setting these aside in a cool
place. Parboil the head in salted water, drain off this,
wipe the head dry, and wash all over with beaten egg;
dredge thickly with bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper,
sage, and onion, and roast, basting twice with butter and
water; then with the liquor in which the head was boiled;
at last with the gravy that runs from the meat. Wash
the brains in several waters until they are white; beat
to a smooth paste, add one-quarter part fine bread-crumbs,
pepper, and salt; make into balls, binding with a
beaten egg; roll in flour and fry in hot fat to a light
brown. Arrange about the head when it is dished.
Skim the gravy left in the dripping-pan, thicken with
brown flour, add the juice of a lemon, and boil up once.
Pour it over the head.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pig’s Head with Liver and Heart</span> (<i>Stewed</i>).</h3>

<p>Clean and split the head, taking out the brains and
setting aside. Put the head in a pot with water enough
to cover it and parboil it. Have ready another pot with
the liver and heart, cut into inch-long pieces, stewed in
just enough water to keep them from scorching. When
the head is half-done, add the entire contents of the
second vessel to the first, and season with salt, pepper, a
little onion, parsley, and sage. Cover and stew until the
head is very tender, when take it out and lay it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
middle of a flat dish. With a perforated skimmer remove
the liver and heart and spread about the head,
surrounding, but not covering it. Strain the gravy and
return to the pot, thicken with brown flour, squeeze in the
juice of a lemon, and drop in carefully force-meat balls of
the brains, prepared according to the foregoing receipt
and fried a light brown. Boil once and pour about the
head, arranging the balls upon it, to cover the split between
the two sides of the head.</p>

<p>You may improve this dish, which is very savory, by
boiling a couple of pigs’ feet with the head until the meat
will slip from the bones. Take them from the liquor, cut
off and chop the meat, and put into the large pot when
you add the liver, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Souse of Pigs’ Ears and Feet.</span></h3>

<p>Clean the ears and feet well; cover them with cold
water slightly salted, and boil until tender. Pack in
stone jars while hot, and cover while you make ready the
pickle. To half a gallon of good cider vinegar allow half
a cup of white sugar, three dozen whole black peppers, a
dozen blades of mace, and a dozen cloves. Boil this one
minute, taking care that it really boils, and pour while hot
over the still warm feet and ears. It will be ready to use
in two days, and will keep in a cool, dry place two months.</p>

<p>If you wish it for breakfast, make a batter of one egg,
one cup of milk, salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter,
with enough flour for a thin muffin-batter; dip each piece
in this, and fry in hot lard or dripping. Or dip each in
beaten egg, then in pounded cracker, before frying.</p>

<p>Souse is also good eaten cold, especially the feet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Head Cheese.</span> (<span class="smcap">or Souse.</span>)</h3>

<p>This is made of the head, ears and tongue. Boil them
in salted water until very tender. Strip the meat from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the bones and chop fine. Season with salt, pepper, sage,
sweet marjoram, a little powdered cloves, and half a cup
of strong vinegar. Mix all together thoroughly, taste to
see that it is flavored sufficiently, remembering that the
spice tends to keep it, and pack hard in moulds or bowls,
interspersing the layers with bits of the tongue cut in
oblongs, squares and triangles not less than an inch in
length. Press down and keep the meat in shape by putting
a plate on the top of each mould (first wetting the
plate) and a weight upon this. In two days the cheese will
be ready for use. Turn out from the shapes as you wish
to use it; or, should you desire to keep it several weeks,
take the cheese from the moulds and immerse in cold vinegar
in stone jars. This will preserve it admirably, and
you have only to pare away the outside, should it be too
acid for your taste.</p>

<p>This is generally eaten cold for tea, with vinegar and
mustard; but it is very nice cut in slices, seasoned slightly
with mustard, and warmed in a frying-pan with enough
butter to prevent burning. Or, you may dip in beaten
egg, then cracker-crumbs, and fry for breakfast.</p>

<p>If the tongue is arranged judiciously the slices will be
prettily marbled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork Pot-pie.</span></h3>

<p>You can make this of lean pork cut from any part of
the pig, but the chine is best. Crack the bones well,
and cut up the chine into <i>riblettes</i> two inches long. Line
your pot, which should be round at the bottom and well
greased, with a good light paste; put in the meat, then a
layer of parboiled potatoes, split in half, seasoning with
pepper and salt as you go on. When the pot is nearly
full, pour in a quart of cold water and put on the upper
crust, cutting a small round hole out of the middle, through
which you can add hot water should the gravy boil away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
too fast. Slips of paste may also be strewed among the
meat and potatoes. Put on the pot-lid, and boil from one
hour and a half to two hours. When done, remove the
upper crust carefully, turn out the meat and gravy into a
bowl, that you may get at the lower. Lay this upon a
hot dish, put the meat, etc., in order upon it, pour the
gravy over it, and cover with the top crust. This can be
browned with a red-hot shovel, or oven-lid.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheshire Pork-pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut two or three pounds of lean fresh pork into strips
as long and as wide as your middle finger. Line a buttered
dish with puff-paste; put in a layer of pork seasoned with
pepper, salt, and nutmeg or mace; next a layer of juicy
apples, sliced and covered with about an ounce of white
sugar; then more pork, and so on until you are ready for
the paste cover, when pour in half a pint of sweet cider or
wine, and stick bits of butter all over the top. Cover with
a thick lid of puff-paste, cut a slit in the top, brush over
with beaten egg, and bake an hour and a half.</p>

<p>This is an English dish, and is famous in the region
from which it takes its name. It is much liked by those
who have tried it, and is considered by some to be equal
to our mince-pie.</p>

<p>Yorkshire pork-pie is made in the same way, with the
omission of the apples, sugar, and nutmeg, and the addition
of sage to the seasoning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sausage</span> (<i>No. 1</i>).</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 lbs. lean fresh pork.</li>
<li>3 lbs. fat fresh pork.</li>
<li>12 teaspoonfuls powdered sage.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>6 teaspoonfuls black pepper.</li>
<li>6 teaspoonfuls salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls powdered mace.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls powdered cloves.</li>
<li>1 grated nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grind the meat, fat and lean, in a sausage-mill, or chop
it very fine. The mill is better, and the grinding does not
occupy one-tenth of the time that chopping does, to say
nothing of the labor. One can be bought for three or four
dollars, and will well repay the purchaser. Mix the seasoning
in with your hands, taste to be sure all is right, and
pack down in stone jars, pouring melted lard on top.
Another good way of preserving them is, to make long,
narrow bags of stout muslin, large enough to contain, each,
enough sausage for a family dish. Fill these with the meat,
dip in melted lard, and hang from the beams of the cellar.</p>

<p>If you wish to pack in the intestines of the hog, they
should be carefully prepared as follows: Empty them, cut
them in lengths, and lay for two days in salt and water.
Turn them inside out, and lay in soak one day longer.
Scrape them, rinse well in soda and water, wipe, and blow
into one end, having tied up the other with a bit of
twine. If they are whole and clear, stuff with the meat;
tie up and hang in the store-room or cellar.</p>

<p>These are fried in the cases, in a clean, dry frying-pan,
until brown. If you have the sausage-meat in bulk,
make into small, round flat cakes, and fry in the same
way. Some dip in egg and pounded cracker—others
roll in flour before cooking. Their own fat will cook
them. Send to table dry and hot, but do not let them
fry hard. When one side is done, turn the other. The
fire should be very brisk. Ten minutes, or twelve at
the outside, is long enough to cook them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sausage</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>)</h3>

<li>10 teaspoonfuls sage.</li>
<li>5 teaspoonfuls pepper.</li>
<li>5 teaspoonfuls salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grind and season as directed in No. 1.</p>


<p>This will not keep so long as that made according to
the former receipt, but is very good for immediate
family use.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sausage</span> (<i>No. 3.</i>)</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bologna Sausage</span> (<i>Uncooked.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 lbs. lean pork.</li>
<li>3 lbs. lean  beef.</li>
<li>2 lbs. beef suet.</li>
<li>4 ounces salt.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls black pepper.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls cayenne.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>2 teaspoonfuls powdered cloves.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful allspice.</li>
<li>One minced onion, very finely chopped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop or grind the meat, and mix the seasoning well
through it. Pack it in beef-skins (or entrails) prepared
as you do those of pork. In the city, you can have these
cleaned by your butcher, or get them ready for use from a
pork merchant. Tie both ends tightly, and lay them in
brine strong enough to bear up an egg. Let them be in
this for a week; change the brine, and let them remain in
this a week longer. Turn them over every day of the
fortnight. Then take them out, wipe them, and send them
to be smoked, if you have no smoke-house of your own.
When well smoked, rub them over with sweet oil or fresh
butter, and hang them in a cool, dark place.</p>

<p>Bologna sausage is sometimes eaten raw, but the dread
of the fatal <i>trichinæ</i> should put at end to this practice, did
not common sense teach us that it must be unwholesome,
no less than disgusting. Cut in round, thick slices, and
toast on a gridiron, or fry in their own fat. If you mean
to keep it some time, rub over the skins with pepper to
keep away insects.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bologna Sausage</span> (<i>Cooked.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 lbs. lean beef.</li>
<li>2 lbs. lean veal.</li>
<li>2 lbs. lean pork</li>
<li>2 lbs. <i>fat</i> salt pork—not smoked.</li>
<li>1 lb. beef suet</li>
<li>10 teaspoonfuls powdered sage.</li>
<li>1 oz. marjoram, parsley, savory, and thyme, mixed.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>2 teaspoonfuls cayenne pepper, and the same of black.</li>
<li>1 grated nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cloves.</li>
<li>1 minced onion.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop or grind the meat and suet; season, and stuff into
beef-skins; tie these up; prick each in several places to
allow the escape of the steam; put into hot—not boiling
water, and heat gradually to the boiling-point. Cook
slowly for one hour; take out the skins and lay them to
dry in the sun, upon clean, sweet straw or hay. Rub the
outside of the skins with oil or melted butter, and hang in
a cool, dry cellar. If you mean to keep it more than a
week, rub pepper or powdered ginger upon the outside.
You can wash it off before sending to table. This is eaten
without further cooking. Cut in round slices, and lay
sliced lemon around the edge of the dish, as many like to
squeeze a few drops upon the sausage before eating.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lard.</span></h3>

<p>Every housekeeper knows how unfit for really nice
cooking is the pressed lard sold in stores as the “best and
cheapest.” It is close and tough, melts slowly, and is
sometimes diversified by fibrous lumps. And even when
lard has been “tried out” by the usual process, it is often
mixed with so much water as to remind us unpleasantly
that it is bought by weight.</p>

<p>The best way of preparing the “leaf lard,” as it is called,
is to skin it carefully, wash, and let it drain; then put it,
cut into bits, into a large, clean tin kettle or bucket, and
set this in a pot of boiling water. Stir from time to time
until it is melted; throw in a very little salt, to make the
sediment settle; and when it is hot—(it should not boil
fast at any time, but simmer gently until clear)—strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
through a close cloth into jars. Do not squeeze the cloth
so long as the clear fat will run through, and when you
do, press the refuse into a different vessel, to be used for
commoner purposes than the other.</p>

<p>Most of the lard in general use is, however, made from
the fatty portions of pork lying next the skin of the hog,
and are left for this purpose by the butcher. Scrape from
the rind, and cut all into dice. Fill a large pot, putting
in a teacupful of water to prevent scorching, and melt very
slowly, stirring every few minutes. Simmer until there
remains nothing of the meat but fibrous bits. Remove
these carefully with a perforated skimmer; throw in a little
salt, to settle the fat, and when it is clear strain through a
fine cullender, a sieve, or a coarse cloth. Dip the latter
in boiling water, should it become clogged by the cooling
lard. Observe the directions about squeezing the strainer.
If your family is small, bear in mind that the lard keeps
longer in small than large vessels. Set away the jars,
closely covered, in a cool, dry cellar or store-room.</p>

<p>In trying out lard, the chief danger is of burning.
Simmer gently over a steady fire, and give it your whole
attention until it is done. A moment’s neglect will ruin
all. Stir very often—almost constantly at the last—and
from the bottom, until the salt is thrown in to settle it,
when withdraw to a less hot part of the fire. Bladders
tied over lard jars are the best protection; next to these,
paper, and outside of this, cloths dipped in melted grease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brawn</span> (No. 1.)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Pig’s head weighing 6 lbs.</li>
<li>1 lb. lean beef.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>½ teaspoonful pepper (black or white).</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful mace.</li>
<li>A pinch of cloves.</li>
<li>A small onion minced very fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clean and wash the head, and stew with the beef in
enough cold water to cover. When the bones will slip out
easily, remove them, after draining off the liquor. Chop
the meat finely while it is hot, season, and pour all into a
mould, wet inside with cold water. If you can have a tin
mould made in the shape of a boar’s head, your brawn will
look well at a Christmas feast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brawn</span> (No. 2.)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Pig’s head, feet, and ears.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of black pepper, and same of cayenne.</li>
<li>4 teaspoonfuls powdered sage.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mace.</li>
<li>An onion minced.</li>
<li>Salt and saltpetre.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the head twelve hours, and lay in a strong brine,
with a tablespoonful of saltpetre. Let it lie three days in
this; rinse; then boil it until you can draw out the bones.
Do this very carefully from the back and under-side of the
head, breaking the outline of the top as little as possible.
Chop the meat of the feet and ears, which should have
been boiled with the head, season to taste with the spices
I have indicated (tastes vary in these matters), beat in
the brains, or two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Fill up
the hollows left by the removal of the bones with this
mixture. Tie in a flannel cloth, sewing this tightly into
the shape of the head; boil an hour and a quarter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
set aside to drain and cool. Do not remove the cloth
until next day. This will be found very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Saveloys.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>8 lbs. pork.</li>
<li>4 teaspoonfuls black pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cayenne.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cloves or mace.</li>
<li>8 teaspoonfuls sage, sweet marjoram, and thyme, mixed.</li>
<li>1 teacupful bread-crumbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lay the meat, which should be young pork, in a brine
of salt and water, with a tablespoonful of saltpetre, and
leave it for three days. Dry and mince it, season,
and add the grated bread. Stuff in skins, and bake,
closely covered, in an oven for half an hour. Or, what
is better, steam over boiling water one hour.</p>

<p>Eat either hot or cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Pickle Pork.</span> (<span class="smcap">No. 1.</span>)</h3>

<p>Hams, shoulders, chines, and “middlings,” are the
parts of the hog which are usually pickled. This should
be done as soon as may be after the meat is fairly cold—especially
in moderate weather. When you can pack down
pork, within twenty-four hours after butchering, it is best
to do so, unless the cold be severe enough to preserve it
longer.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4½ lbs. salt.</li>
<li>1 lb. brown sugar.</li>
<li>1 oz. saltpetre in 3 gallons of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put into a large saucepan and boil for half an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
skimming off the scum. When cold, pour over the meat,
and let it lie for a few days.</p>

<p>This is intended to corn a small quantity of meat for
family use.</p>


<h3>(<span class="smcap">No. 2.</span>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>80 lbs. of meat.</li>
<li>2 quarts and 1 pint of fine salt.</li>
<li>4 lbs. sugar, or 1 quart best molasses.</li>
<li>3 oz. saltpetre.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulverize and mix the seasoning, with the exception of
the two quarts of salt, using the one pint only. Rub the
meat <i>well</i> all over, and lay upon boards on the cellar-floor
for twenty-four hours. Then, put a few clean stones in
the bottom of a barrel; lay sticks across these, that the
meat may not soak in the liquor that drains from it. Pack
the meat in layers, strewing between these the remaining
two quarts of salt. Let it lie in the cask for fifteen or
sixteen days, every day during this time tipping the cask
to drain off the liquor, or drawing it through a bung-hole
near the bottom. Pour this back in cupfuls over the meat.</p>

<p>If you do not mean to smoke the meat, take it out at
the end of the fortnight, rub each piece well over with dry
salt, and return to the barrel. If the liquor does not cover
it, make fresh brine in the proportion of two pounds of
salt, a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and a quart of
water, and pour in when you have boiled it half an hour
and let it cool. Lay a round piece of board upon the
upper layer and keep this down with stones. Examine
from time to time, to be sure the meat is keeping well.
Should it seem likely to taint, throw away the pickle, rub
each piece over with dry salt, and pack anew. Pork
pickled in this way will keep two years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Cure Hams.</span></h3>

<p>Having pickled your hams with the rest of your pork
as just directed, take them, after the lapse of sixteen days,
from the packing barrel, with the shoulders and jowls.
At the South they empty the cask, and consign the “whole
hog” to the smoke-house. Wash off the pickle, and, while
wet, dip in bran. Some use saw-dust, but it is not so good.
Others use neither, only wipe the meat dry and smoke.
The object in dipping in bran or saw-dust is to form a
crust which prevents the evaporation of the juices. Be
sure that it is well covered with the bran, then hang in
the smoke, the hock end downward. Keep up a good
smoke, by having the fire partially smothered with hickory
chips and saw dust, for four weeks, taking care the house
does not become hot. Take down the meat, brush off the
bran, examine closely, and if you suspect insects, lay it in
the hot sun for a day or two.</p>

<p>The various ways of keeping hams—each strongly
recommended by those who have practised it—are too
numerous to mention here. Some pack in wood ashes;
others, in dry oats; others, in bran. But the best authorities
discard packing altogether. I will name one or two
methods which I know have been successful. “I hang
mine on hooks from wires, at the top of my granary,
which is tight and dark,” says an excellent judge and
manufacturer of hams. “They are good and sweet when
a year old.” Another admirable housekeeper covers with
brown paper, then with coarse muslin stitched tightly and
fitting closely, then whitewashes. But for the paper, the
lime would be apt to eat away the grease. Still another
covers with muslin, and coats with a mixture of bees-wax
and rosin. There is no doubt that the covers are an excellent
precaution—provided always, that the insects have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not already deposited their eggs in the meat. The bran
coating tends to prevent this.</p>

<p>I have eaten ham twenty years old in Virginia, which
had been kept sweet in <i>slaked</i> ashes. Unslaked will act
like lime upon the fat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak in water over night. Next morning wash hard
with a coarse cloth or stiff brush, and put on to boil with
plenty of cold water. Allow a quarter of an hour to each
pound in cooking, and do not boil too fast. Do not
remove the skin until cold; it will come off easily and
cleanly then, and the juices are better preserved than
when it is stripped hot. Send to table with dots of pepper
or dry mustard on the top, a tuft of fringed paper twisted
about the shank, and garnish with parsley.</p>

<p>Cut very thin in carving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Ham.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Brush the ham—a cold boiled one, from which the
skin has been taken—well, all over with beaten egg. To
a cup of powdered cracker allow enough rich milk or
cream to make into a thick paste, salt, and work in a teaspoonful
of melted butter. Spread this evenly a quarter
of an inch thick over the ham, and set to brown in a moderate
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Ham.</span></h3>

<p>This is by far the best way of cooking a ham. Lay in
cold water for twelve hours; wash very thoroughly, rubbing
with a stiff brush, to dislodge the salt and smoke on
the outside. Put into a steamer, cover closely, and set it
over a pot of boiling water. Allow at least twenty
minutes to a pound. Keep the water at a hard boil.</p>

<p>If you serve ham hot, skin, and immediately strew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
thickly with cracker or bread-crumbs, to prevent the waste
of the essence. Put a frill of paper about the knuckle.
Send around cabbage or other green vegetables with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak for twelve hours. Trim away the rusty part from
the under side and edges, wipe very dry, cover the bottom
with a paste made of flour and hot water, and lay it upside
down in the dripping-pan, with water enough to keep it
from burning. Bake five hours, or allow fully twenty-five
minutes to a pound. Baste now and then, to prevent the
crust from cracking and scaling off. When done, peel off
this and the skin, and glaze as you would a cold ham.</p>

<p>Put cut paper about the knuckle, and garnish with
parsley and sliced red beet—pickled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak for two days in lukewarm water, changing at least
six times a day. Take it out, wash very well, scrubbing
the under part hard, and trimming away the black and
rusty edges. Skin with care, lest you mangle the meat
and spoil the symmetry of the shape. Lay in a dish and
sponge with a cloth dipped in a mixture of wine, vinegar,
sugar, and mustard—about a tablespoonful of white sugar,
a saltspoonful of made mustard, and a glass of wine to
half a gill of vinegar. Do this at intervals of an hour,
washing every part of the ham well, all day and until bed-time.
Renew the process next morning until six hours
before you need the meat. Put it upon the spit or in the
dripping-pan, with a cup of hot water to prevent burning.
Add to the mixture—or what is left of it in the dish—a
cupful of boiling water. Keep this on the stove and baste
continually with it until the liquor flows freely from the
ham as it cooks; then substitute the gravy. When done
(you must test with a fork), cover with cracker-crumbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
worked to a paste with milk, butter, and a beaten egg,
and return to the oven to brown.</p>

<p>Skim the gravy; add a glass of good wine, a tablespoonful
of catsup,—walnut, if you have it,—the juice
of a lemon, and a little nutmeg. Boil up, and send to
table in a boat.</p>

<p>Troublesome as the mode of cooking it may seem, roast
ham is so delicious—especially when cold—as fully to
recompense the housekeeper who may be tempted to
try it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Cut in slices. Wash well, and soak in scalding water
in a covered vessel for half an hour. Pour off the water,
and add more boiling water. Wipe dry when the ham has
stood half an hour in the second water, and lay in cold
for five minutes. Wipe again and broil over (or under) a
clear fire.</p>

<p>Cold boiled ham, that is not too much done, is better
for broiling than raw. Pepper before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Barbecued Ham.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>If your ham is raw, soak as above directed; then lay
the slices flat in a frying-pan; pepper each and lay upon
it a quarter of a teaspoonful of made mustard. Pour about
them some vinegar, allowing half a teaspoonful to each
slice. Fry quickly and turn often. When done to a fine
brown, transfer to a hot dish: add to the gravy in the pan
half a glass of wine and a very small teaspoonful of white
sugar. Boil up and pour over the meat.</p>

<p>Underdone ham is nice barbecued.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Ham.</span></h3>

<p>If raw, soak as for broiling. Cook in a hot frying-pan
turning often until done. Serve with or without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
gravy, as you please. In some parts of the country it is
customary to take the meat first from the pan, and add
to the gravy a little cream, then thicken with flour. Boil
up once and pour over the ham. A little chopped parsley
is a pleasant addition to this gravy.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may dip some slices of cold boiled ham—cut rather
thick—in beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry them
in fat extracted from some bits of salt pork. Take the
dry fried pork from the pan before putting in the ham.
Garnish with crisped parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham Sandwiches.</span></h3>

<p>Cut some slices of bread in a neat shape, and trim off
the crust, unless it is very tender. Butter them and lay
between every two some thin slices of cold boiled ham.
Spread the meat with a little mustard if you like.</p>

<p>Ground ham makes delicious sandwiches. Cut the
bread very thin, and butter well. Put in a good layer of
ham, and press the two sides of the sandwiches firmly, but
gently, together. Then roll lengthwise, and pile in a plate
or basket.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Chicken Sandwiches.</span></h3>

<p>Mince some cold roast chicken, and a like quantity of
cold boiled ham. Put the mixture into a saucepan, with
enough gravy—chicken or veal—to make a soft paste. If
you have no gravy, use a little hot water, a few spoonfuls
of cream, and a fair lump of butter. Season with pepper
to your taste. Stir while it heats almost to boiling, working
it very smooth. In about five minutes after it begins
to smoke, take from the fire and spread in a dish to cool.
With a good-sized cake-cutter, or a plain thin-edged tumbler,
cut some rounds of cold bread, and butter one side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of each. Sprinkle the buttered sides with grated cheese,
and, when the chicken is cold, put a layer between these.</p>

<p>These sandwiches are simple and very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Chicken Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up and parboil a tender young chicken—a year
old is best. Line a deep dish with a good pie-crust.
Cut some thin slices of cold boiled ham, and spread a
layer next the crust; then arrange pieces of the fowl
upon the ham. Cover this, in turn, with slices of hard-boiled
eggs, buttered and peppered. Proceed in this order
until your materials are used up. Then pour in enough
veal or chicken gravy to prevent dryness. Unless you
have put in too much water for the size of the fowl, the
liquor in which the chicken was boiled is best for this
purpose. Bake one hour and a quarter for a large pie.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut your slices of ham of a uniform size and shape.
Fry quickly, and take them out of the pan as soon as
they are done. Have the eggs ready, and drop them, one
at a time, in the hissing fat. Have a large pan for this
purpose, that they may not touch and run together. In
three minutes they will be done. The meat should be
kept hot, and when the eggs are ready, lay one upon each
slice of ham, which should have been cut the proper size
for this. Do not use the gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork and Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil a piece of the middling of salt pork, and score
the skin. Allow a pound to a quart of dried beans, which
must be soaked over night in lukewarm water. Change
this twice for more and warmer water, and in the morning
put them on to boil in cold. When they are soft, drain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
off the liquor, put the beans in a deep dish, and half-bury
the pork in the middle, adding a very little warm water.
Bake a nice brown.</p>

<p>This is a favorite dish with New England farmers and
many others. Although old-fashioned, it still makes its
weekly appearance upon the tables of hundreds of well-to-do
families.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork and Peas Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the pork, which should not be a fat piece, over
night in cold water; and in another pan a quart of dried
split peas. In the morning put on the peas to boil slowly
until tender. Drain and rub through a cullender; season
with pepper and salt, and mix with them two tablespoonfuls
of butter and two beaten eggs. Beat all well together.
Have ready a floured pudding-cloth, and put the pudding
into it. Tie it up, leaving room for swelling; put on in
warm, not hot water, with the pork, and boil them together
an hour. Lay the pork in the centre of the dish, turn out
the pudding, slice and arrange about the meat.</p>

<h2>COMPANY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Laying</span> to your conduct the line and plummet of the
Golden Rule, never pay a visit (I use the word in contradistinction
to “call”) without notifying your hostess-elect
of your intention thus to favor her.</p>

<p>Perhaps once in ten thousand times, your friend—be
she mother, sister, or intimate acquaintance—may be enraptured
at your unexpected appearance, travelling-satchel
in hand, at her door, to pass a day, a night, or a month;
or may be pleasantly surprised when you take the baby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and run in to tea in a social way. But the chances are so
greatly in favor of the probability that you will upset her
household arrangements, abrade her temper, or put her
to undue trouble or embarrassment, by this evidence of
your wish to have her feel quite easy with you, to treat you
as one of the family, that it is hardly worth your while to
risk so much in order to gain so little.</p>

<p>Mrs. Partington has said more silly things than any
other woman of her age in this country; but she spoke
wisely in declaring her preference for those surprise-parties
“when people sent word they were coming.” Do not be
ashamed to say to your nearest kin, or the confidante of
your school-days—“Always let me know when to look for
you, that I may so order my time and engagements as to
secure the greatest possible pleasure from your visit.” If
you are the woman I take you to be—methodical, industrious,
and ruling your household according to just and
firm laws of order and punctuality, you need this notice.
If you are likewise social and hospitable, your rules are
made with reference to possible and desirable interruptions
of this nature. It only requires a little closer packing of
certain duties, an easy exchange of times and seasons, and
leisure is obtained for the right enjoyment of your friend’s
society. The additional place is set at table; your spare
bed, which yesterday was tossed into a heap that both mattresses
might be aired, and covered lightly with a thin
spread, is made up with fresh sheets that have not
gathered damp and must from lying packed beneath
blankets and coverlets for may be a month, for fear somebody
might happen in to pass the night, and catch you
with the bed in disorder. Towels and water are ready;
the room is bright and dustless; the dainty dish so far
prepared for dinner or tea as to be like Mrs. Bagnet’s
greens, “off your mind;” John knows whom he is to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
at his home-coming; the children are clean, and on the
<i>qui vive</i>—children’s instincts are always hospitable. The
guest’s welcome is half given in the air of the house and
the family group before you have time to utter a word.
It may have appeared to her a useless formality to despatch
the note or telegram you insisted upon. She knows
you love her, and she would be wounded by the thought
that she could ever “come amiss” to your home. Perhaps,
as she lays aside her travelling-dress, she smiles at
your “ceremonious, old-maidish ways,” and marvels that
so good a manager should deem such forms necessary with
an old friend.</p>

<p>If she had driven to your house at nightfall, to discover
that you had gone with husband and children to pass
several days with John’s mother, in a town fifty miles
away, and that the servants were out “a-pleasuring” in
the mistress’ absence; if she had found you at home,
nursing three children through the measles, she having
brought her youngest with her; if you were yourself the
invalid, bound hand and foot to a Procrustean couch, and
utterly unable even to see her—John, meanwhile, being
incapacitated from playing the part of agreeable host by
worry and anxiety; if, on the day before her arrival, your
chambermaid had gone off in a “tiff,” leaving you to do
her work and to nurse your cook, sick in the third story;
if earlier comers than herself had filled every spare mattress
in the house;—if any one of these, or a dozen other
ills to which housekeepers are heirs, had impressed upon
her the idea that her visit was inopportune, she might
think better of your “punctilio.”</p>

<p>But since unlooked-for visitors will occasionally drop
in upon the best regulated families, make it your study to
receive them gracefully and cordially. If they care enough
for you to turn aside from their regular route to tarry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
day, or night, or week with you, it would be churlish not
to show appreciation of the favor in which you are held.
Make them welcome to the best you can offer at so short
a notice, and let no preoccupied air or troubled smile
bear token to your perturbation—if you are perturbed.
If you respect yourself and your husband, the appointments
of your table will never put you to the blush. John,
who buys the silver, glass, china, and napery, is entitled
to the every-day use of the best. You may have—I hope
this is so—a holiday set of each, put away beyond the
reach of hourly accidents; but if this is fit for the use of
a lord, do not make John eat three hundred and sixty
days in the year from such ware as would suit a ditcher’s
cottage. If your children never see bright silver unless
when “there is company,” you cannot wonder, although
you will be mortified, at their making looking-glasses of
the bowls of the spoons, and handling the forks awkwardly.
Early impress upon them that what is nice
enough for Papa, is nice enough for the President. I
have noticed that where there is a wide difference between
family and company table furniture, there usually exists
a corresponding disparity between every-day and company
manners.</p>

<p>Especially, let your welcome be ready and hearty when
your husband brings home an unexpected guest. Take
care he understands clearly that this is his prerogative:
that the rules by which you would govern the visits of
your own sex are not applicable to his. Men rarely set
seasons for their visits. They snatch an hour or two with
an old chum or new friend out of the hurry of business
life, as one stoops to pluck a stray violet from a dusty
roadside. John must take his chances when he can get
them. If he can walk home, arm in arm, with the school-fellow
he has not seen before in ten years, not only fearlessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but gladly, anticipatory of your pleasure at the
sight of his; if, when the stranger is presented to you, you
receive him as your friend because he is your husband’s,
and seat him to a family dinner, plain, but nicely served,
and eaten in cheerfulness of heart; if the children are
well-behaved, and your attire that of a lady who has not
lost the desire to look her best in her husband’s eyes—you
have added to the links of steel that knit your husband’s
heart to you; increased his affectionate admiration
for the best little woman in the world. Many a man has
been driven to entertain his friends at hotels and club-rooms,
because he dared not take them home without permission
from the presiding officer of his household. The
majority of healthy men have good appetites and are not
disposed to be critical of an unpretending bill of fare.
The chance guest of this sex is generally an agreeable
addition to the family group, instead of <i>de trop</i>—always
supposing him to be John’s friend.</p>

<p>As to party and dinner-giving, your safest rule is to
obey the usage of the community in which you live in
minor points, letting common sense and your means guide
you in essentials. Be chary of undertaking what you cannot
carry through successfully. Pretension is the ruin of
more entertainments than ignorance or lack of money. If
you know how to give a large evening party (and think it
a pleasant and remunerative investment of time and several
hundred dollars)—if you understand the machinery of
a handsome dinner-party, and can afford these luxuries,
go forward bravely to success. But creep before you
walk. Study established customs in the best managed
houses you visit; take counsel with experienced friends;
now and then make modest essays on your own responsibility,
and, insensibly, these crumbs of wisdom will form
into a comely loaf. There is no surer de-appetizer—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
coin a word—to guests than a heated, over-fatigued,
anxious hostess, who betrays her inexperience by nervous
glances, abstraction in conversation, and, worst of all, by
apologies.</p>

<p>A few general observations are all I purpose to offer as
hints of a foundation upon which to build your plans for
“company-giving.” Have an abundance of clean plates,
silver, knives, &amp;c., laid in order in a convenient place,—such
as an ante-room, or dining-room pantry,—those designed
for each course, if your entertainment is a dinner,
upon a shelf or stand by themselves, and make your waiters
understand distinctly in advance in what order these
are to be brought on.</p>

<p>Soup should be sent up accompanied only by bread, and
such sauce as may be fashionable or suitable. Before
dinner is served, however, snatch a moment, if possible,
to inspect the table in person, or instruct a trustworthy
factotum to see that everything is in place, the water in
the goblets, a slice of bread laid upon a folded napkin at
each plate, &amp;c. Unless you have trained, professional
waiters, this is a wise precaution. If it is a gentleman’s
dinner, you can see to it for yourself, since you will not be
obliged to appear in the parlor until a few minutes before
they are summoned to the dining-room. If there are
ladies in the company, you must not leave them.</p>

<p>To return, then, to our soup: It is not customary to
offer a second plateful to a guest. When the table is
cleared, the fish should come in, with potatoes—no other
vegetable, unless it be stewed tomatoes. After a thorough
change of plates, &amp;c., come the substantials. If possible,
the carving of game and other meats is done before they
are brought in. One or more vegetables are passed with
each meat course. Salad is a course of itself, unless when
it accompanies chicken or pigeon. If wine be used, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
introduced after the fish. Pastry is the first relay of dessert,
and puddings may be served from the other end of
the table. Next appear creams, jellies, charlotte-russes,
cakes, and the like; then fruit and nuts; lastly, coffee,
often accompanied with crackers and cheese. Wine, of
course, goes around during the dessert—if it flows at all.</p>

<p>Evening parties are less troublesome to a housekeeper,
because less ceremonious than dinners. If you can afford
it, the easiest way to give a large one is to put the whole
business into the hands of the profession, by intrusting
your order, not only for supper, but waiters and china, to
a competent confectioner. But a social standing supper
of oysters, chicken-salad, sandwiches, coffee, ice-cream,
jellies, and cake, is not a formidable undertaking when
you have had a little practice, especially if your own, or
John’s mother, or the nice, neighborly matron over the
way will assist you by her advice and presence. The
“Ladies’ Lunch” and afternoon “Kettle-Drum” are
social and graceful “modern improvements.”</p>

<p>We make this matter of company too hard a business
in America; are too apt to treat our friends as the Strasburgers
do their geese; shut them up in overheated quarters,
and stuff them to repletion. Our rooms would be
better for more air, our guests happier had they more
liberty, and our hostess would be prettier and more
sprightly were she not overworked before the arrivals
begin, and full of trepidation after they come,—a woman
cumbered with many thoughts of serving, while she is
supposed to be enjoying the society of her chosen associates.
It is so well understood that company is weariness,
that inquiries as to how the principal agent in bringing
about an assembly has “borne it,” have passed into a custom.
The tender sympathies manifested in such queries,
the martyr-like air with which they are answered, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
fail to bring to the satirical mind the Chinaman’s comment
upon the British officers’ dancing on shipboard in
warm weather.</p>

<p>“Why you no make your servants do so hard work,
and you look at dem?”</p>

<p>We pervert the very name and meaning of hospitality
when we pinch our families, wear away our patience, and
waste our nervous forces with our husbands’ money
in getting up to order expensive entertainments for comparative
strangers, whose utmost acknowledgment of our
efforts in their behalf will consist in an invitation, a year
hence it may be, to a party constructed on the same plan,
managed a little better or a little worse than ours. This
is not hospitality without grudging, but a vulgar system
of barter and gluttony more worthy of Abyssinians than
Christian gentlefolk.</p>

<h2><a id="GAME"></a>GAME.</h2>



<h3>VENISON.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I once</span> received a letter from the wife of an Eastern
man who had removed to the Great West, in which bitter
complaints were made of the scarcity of certain comforts—ice-cream
and candy among them—to which she had been
accustomed in other days. “My husband shot a fine deer
this morning,” she wrote, “but I could never endure <i>venzon</i>.
Can you tell me of any way of cooking it so as to
make it tolerably eatible?” I did not think it very singular
that one whose chief craving in the goodly land in
which she had found a home was for cocoanut cakes and
chocolate caramels, should not like the viand the name of
which she could not spell. Nor did I wonder that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
failed to make it “eatible,” or doubt that her cooking
matched her orthography. But I am amazed often at
hearing really skilful housewives pronounce it an undesirable
dish. In the hope of in some measure correcting
this impression among Eastern cooks, who, it must be
allowed, rarely taste really fresh venison, I have written
out, with great care and particularity, the following receipts,
most of which I have used in my own family with
success and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The dark color of the meat,—I mean now not the black,
but rich reddish-brown flesh,—so objectionable to the
uninitiated, is to the gourmand one of its chief recommendations
to his favor. It should also be fine of grain and
well coated with fat.</p>

<p>Keep it hung up in a cool, dark cellar, covered with a
cloth, and use as soon as you can conveniently.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Haunch of Venison.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>If the outside be hard, wash off with lukewarm water;
then rub all over with fresh butter or lard. Cover it on
the top and sides with a thick paste of flour and water,
nearly half an inch thick. Lay upon this a large sheet of
thin white wrapping-paper well buttered, and above this
thick foolscap. Keep all in place by greased pack-thread,
then put down to roast with a little water in the dripping-pan.
Let the fire be steady and strong. Pour a few
ladlefuls of butter and water over the meat now and then,
to prevent the paper from scorching. If the haunch is
large, it will take at least five hours to roast. About half
an hour before you take it up, remove the papers and
paste, and test with a skewer to see if it is done. If this
passes easily to the bone through the thickest part, set it
down to a more moderate fire and baste every few minutes
with Claret and melted butter. At the last, baste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with butter, dredge with flour to make a light froth, and
dish. It should be a fine brown by this time. Twist a
frill of fringed paper around the knuckle.</p>

<p>For gravy, put into a saucepan a pound or so of scraps
of raw venison left from trimming the haunch, a quart of
water, a pinch of cloves, a few blades of mace, half a nutmeg,
cayenne and salt to taste. Stew slowly to one-half
the original quantity. Skim, strain, and return to the
saucepan when you have rinsed it with hot water. Add
three tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, a glass of claret,
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and thicken with browned
flour. Send to table in a tureen.</p>

<p>Send around currant jelly with venison <i>always</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neck.</span></h3>

<p>This is roasted precisely as is the haunch, allowing a
quarter of an hour to a pound.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shoulder.</span></h3>

<p>This is also a roasting-piece, but may be cooked without
the paste and paper. Baste often with butter and
water, and toward the last, with Claret and butter. Do
not let it get dry for an instant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Stew a Shoulder,</span></h3>

<p>Extract the bones through the under-side. Make a
stuffing of several slices of fat mutton, minced fine and
seasoned smartly with cayenne, salt, allspice, and wine,
and fill the holes from which the bones were taken. Bind
firmly in shape with broad tape. Put in a large saucepan
with a pint of gravy made from the refuse bits of venison;
add a glass of Madeira or Port wine, and a little black
pepper. Cover tightly, and stew very slowly three or four
hours, according to the size. It should be very tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Remove the tapes with care; dish, and when you have
strained the gravy, pour over the meat.</p>

<p>This is a most savory dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Steaks.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>These are taken from the neck or haunch. Have
your gridiron well buttered, and fire clear and hot. Lay
the steaks on the bars and broil rapidly, turning often, not
to lose a drop of juice. They will take three or four
minutes longer to broil than beef-steaks. Have ready in
a hot chafing-dish a piece of butter the size of an egg for
each pound of venison, a pinch of salt, a little pepper, a
tablespoonful currant-jelly for each pound, and a glass of
wine for every four pounds. This should be liquid, and
warmed by the boiling water under the dish by the time
the steaks are done to a turn. If you have no chafing-dish,
heat in a saucepan. Lay each steak in the mixture singly,
and turn over twice. Cover closely and let all heat together,
with fresh hot water beneath—unless your lamp is
burning—for five minutes before serving. If you serve
in an ordinary dish, cover and set in the oven for the same
time.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If you wish a plainer dish, omit the wine and jelly; pepper
and salt the steaks when broiled, and lay butter upon
them in the proportion I have stated, letting them stand
between hot dishes five minutes before they go to table,
turning them three times in the gravy that runs from them
to mingle with the melted butter. Delicious steaks corresponding
to the shape of mutton chops are cut from the
loin and rack.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Cutlets.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Trim the cutlets nicely, and make gravy of the refuse
bits in the proportion of a cup of cold water to half a pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of venison. Put in bones, scraps of fat, etc., and set on in
a saucepan to stew while you make ready the cutlets.
Lard with slips of fat salt pork a quarter of an inch apart,
and projecting slightly on either side. When the gravy
has stewed an hour, strain and let it cool. Lay the cutlets
in a saucepan, with a few pieces of young onion on
each. Allow one onion to four or five pounds. It should
not be flavored strongly with this. Scatter also a little
minced parsley and thyme between the layers of meat,
with pepper, and a very little nutmeg. The pork lardoons
will salt sufficiently. When you have put in all your
meat, pour in the gravy, which should be warm—not hot.
Stew steadily twenty minutes, take up the cutlets and lay
in a frying-pan in which you have heated just enough
butter to prevent them from burning. Fry five minutes
very quickly, turning the cutlets over and over to brown,
without drying them. Lay in order in a chafing-dish, and
have ready the gravy to pour over them without delay.
This should be done by straining the liquor left in the
saucepan and returning to the fire, with the addition of a
tablespoonful of currant jelly, a teaspoonful Worcestershire
or other piquant sauce, and half a glass of wine.
Thicken with browned flour, boil up well and pour over
the cutlets. Let all stand together in a hot dish five
minutes before serving. Venison which is not fat or juicy
enough for roasting makes a relishable dish cooked after
this receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hashed Venison.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>The remains of cold roast venison—especially a stuffed
shoulder—may be used for this dish, and will give great
satisfaction to cook and consumers. Slice the meat from
the bones. Put these with the fat and other scraps in a
saucepan, with a large teacupful of cold water, a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
onion—one of the button kind, minced, parsley and
thyme, pepper and salt, and three or four whole cloves.
Stew for an hour. Strain and return to the saucepan,
with whatever gravy was left from the roast, a tablespoonful
currant jelly, one of tomato or mushroom catsup, a
teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, and a little browned flour.
Boil for three minutes; lay in the venison, cut into slices
about an inch long, and let all heat over the fire for eight
minutes, but do not allow the hash to boil. Stir frequently,
and when it is smoking hot, turn into a deep-covered
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Fawn.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash thoroughly; stuff with a good force-meat
made of bread-crumbs, chopped pork, pepper and salt, a
little grated nutmeg, the juice of a lemon. Moisten with
water and cream, bind with beaten egg and melted butter.
Sew up the fawn, turning the legs under, and binding
close to the body. Cover with thin slices of fat pork, bound
on with pack-thread, crossing in every direction, and roast
at a quick fire. Allow twenty-two minutes to a pound.
Twenty minutes before it is dished, remove the pork, and
set down the fawn to brown, basting with melted butter.
At the last, dredge with flour, let this brown, froth with
butter, and serve.</p>

<p>Garnish with abundance of curled parsley, dotted with
drops of red currant jelly. A kid can be roasted in the
same way—also hares and rabbits.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Pasty.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is a name dear to the heart of the Englishman
since the days when Friar Tuck feasted the disguised
Cœur de Lion upon it in the depths of Sherwood Forest,
until the present generation. In this country it is comparatively
little known; but I recommend it to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
who have never yet been able to make venison “tolerably
eatable.”</p>

<p>Almost any part of the deer can be used for the purpose,
but the neck and shoulders are generally preferred.</p>

<p>Cut the raw venison from the bones, and set aside these,
with the skin, fat, and refuse bits, for gravy. Put them
into a saucepan with a shallot, pepper, salt, nutmeg and
sweet herbs, cover well with cold water, and set on to boil.
Meanwhile, cut the better and fairer pieces of meat into
squares an inch long, and cook in another saucepan until
three-quarters done. Line a deep dish with good puff-paste.
That for the lid should be made after the receipt appended
to this. Put in the squares of venison, season with pepper,
salt, and butter, and put in half a cupful of the liquor in
which the meat was stewed, to keep it from burning at the
bottom. Cover with a lid of the prepared pastry an inch
thick. Cut a round hole in the middle, and if you have
not a small tin cylinder that will fit this, make one of buttered
paper; stiff writing-paper is best. The hole should
be large enough to admit your thumb. Bake steadily,
covering the top with a sheet of clean paper so soon as it
is firm, to prevent it from browning too fast. While it is
cooking prepare the gravy. When all the substance has
been extracted from the bones, etc., strain the liquor back
into the saucepan; let it come to a boil, and when you
have skimmed carefully, add a glass of Port wine, a tablespoonful
of butter, the juice of a lemon, and some browned
flour to thicken. Boil up once, remove the plug from the
hole in the pastry, and pour in through a small funnel, or
a paper horn, as much gravy as the pie will hold. Do
this very quickly; brush the crust over with beaten egg
and put back in the oven until it is a delicate brown, or
rather, a golden russet. The pie should only be drawn
to the door of the oven for these operations, and everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
should be in readiness before it is taken out, that
the crust may be light and flaky. If you have more gravy
than you need for the dish, serve in a tureen.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Crust of Pasty.</span></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1½ lb. of flour.</li>
<li>12 oz. butter.</li>
<li>Yolks of 3 eggs.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dry and sift the flour and cut up half the butter in it
with a knife or chopper until the whole is fine and yellow;
salt, and work up with ice-water, lastly adding the
yolks beaten very light. Work out rapidly, handling as
little as possible, roll out three times <i>very</i> thin, basting
with butter, then into a lid nearly an inch thick, reserving
a thinner one for ornaments. Having covered in your pie,
cut from the second sheet with a cake-cutter, leaves,
flowers, stars, or any figures you like to adorn the top of
your crust. Bake the handsomest one upon a tin plate
by itself, and brush it over with egg when you glaze the
pie. After the pasty is baked, cover the hole in the centre
with this.</p>

<p>If these directions be closely followed the pasty will be
delicious. Bake two or three hours, guiding yourself by
the size of the pie. It is good hot or cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Hams.</span></h3>

<p>These are eaten raw, and will not keep so long as other
smoked meats.</p>

<p>Mix together in equal proportions, salt and brown
sugar, and rub them hard into the hams with your hand.
Pack them in a cask, sprinkling dry salt between them,
and let them lie eight days, rubbing them over every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with dry salt and sugar. Next mix equal parts of fine
salt, molasses, and a teaspoonful of saltpetre to every two
hams. Take the hams out of the pickle, go over them
with a brush dipped in cider vinegar, then in the new
mixture. Empty the cask, wash it out with cold water,
and repack the hams, dripping from the sticky bath, scattering
fine salt over each. Let them lie eight days longer
in this. Wash off the pickle first with tepid water, until the
salt crystals are removed; then sponge with vinegar, powder
them with bran while wet, and smoke a fortnight, or,
if large, three weeks. Wrap in brown paper that has no
unpleasant odor, stitch a muslin cover over this, and whitewash,
unless you mean to use at once. Chip or shave for
the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Sausages.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>5 lbs. lean venison.</li>
<li>2 lbs. fat salt pork.</li>
<li>5 teaspoonfuls powdered sage.</li>
<li>4 teaspoonfuls salt.</li>
<li>4 teaspoonfuls black pepper.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls cayenne.</li>
<li>1 small onion.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the meat very small, season, and pack in skins or
small stone jars. Hang the skins, and set the jars, tied
down with bladders, in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>Fry as you do other sausages.</p>



<h3>RABBITS OR HARES.</h3>

<p>The tame rabbit is rarely if ever eaten. The wild hare
of the South—in vulgar parlance, “old hare,” although
the creature may be but a day old—exactly corresponds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with the rabbit of the Northern fields, and when fat and
tender may be made into a variety of excellent dishes.</p>

<p>Hares are unfit for eating in the early spring. There
is thus much significance in “Mad as a March hare.” The
real English hare is a much larger animal than that which
is known in this country by this name. To speak
correctly, all our “old field hares” are wild rabbits.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Rabbit.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and soak in water slightly salted for an
hour and a half, changing it once during this time. It is
best to make your butcher or hired man skin it before
you undertake to handle it. Afterward, the task is easy
enough. Parboil the heart and liver, chop fine, and mix
with a slice of fat pork, also minced. Make a force-meat
of bread-crumbs, well seasoned, and working in the minced
meat. Stuff the body with this, and sew it up. Rub with
butter and roast, basting with butter and water until the
gravy flows freely, then with the dripping. It should be
done in an hour. Dredge with flour a few minutes before
taking it up, then froth with butter. Lay in a hot dish,
add to the gravy a little lemon-juice, a young onion
minced, a tablespoonful of butter, and thicken with
browned flour. Give it a boil up, and serve in a tureen
or boat.</p>

<p>Garnish the rabbit with sliced lemon, and put a dot of
currant jelly in the centre of each slice. Cut off the head
before sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rabbits Stewed with Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Clean a pair of nice rabbits; soak in cold salt and
water for an hour, to draw out the blood; put on in a large
saucepan with cold water enough to cover them, salt
slightly, and stew until tender. Slice into another pot half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a dozen young onions, and boil in a very little water until
thoroughly done. Drain off the water, and stir the onions
into a gill of drawn butter, pepper to taste, and when it
simmers, add the juice of a lemon. Cut off the heads of
the hares, lay in a hot dish and pour over them the onion-sauce.
Let the dish stand in a warm place, closely
covered, five minutes before sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Rabbit.</span> (<i>White.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean two young rabbits, cut into joints, and soak in
salt and water an hour. Put into a saucepan with a pint
of cold water, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion finely
minced, a pinch of mace, one of nutmeg, pepper, and half
a pound of fat salt pork, cut into slips. Cover, and stew
until tender. Take out the rabbits and set in a dish
where they will keep warm. Add to the gravy a cup of
cream (or milk), two well-beaten eggs stirred in a little at
a time, and a tablespoonful of butter. Boil up once—when
you have thickened with flour wet in cold milk—and
take the saucepan from the fire. Squeeze in the juice
of a lemon, stirring all the while, and pour over the
rabbits. Do not cook the head or neck.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Rabbit.</span> (<i>Brown.</i>)</h3>

<p>Cut off the head—joint, and lay in soak for an hour.
Season the pieces with pepper and salt, dredge with flour,
and fry in butter or nice dripping until brown. Take
from the fat, lay in a saucepan, and cover with broth made
of bits of veal or lamb. Add a minced onion, a great
spoonful of walnut catsup, a bunch of sweet herbs, a pinch
of cloves and one of allspice, half a teaspoonful of cayenne.
Cover closely, and simmer for half an hour. Lay the
pieces of hare in order upon a hot dish and cover to keep
warm. Strain the gravy, return to the saucepan, thicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with browned flour, put in a tablespoonful of butter,
squeeze in the juice of a lemon, pour over the rabbits, and
send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Rabbit.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the head and divide the body into joints. Lard
with slips of fat pork; put into a clean hot frying-pan
and fry until half done. Have ready some strained gravy
made of veal or beef—the first is better; put the pieces of
rabbit into a saucepan, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a
minced onion, and some pepper. Stew, closely covered,
half an hour, or until tender; take out the rabbits and
lay in a hot covered dish. Strain the gravy, add a tablespoonful
of butter, the juice of a lemon, and thicken with
flour. Boil up and pour over the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Rabbit.</span></h3>

<p>They must be very tender for this purpose. Cut into
joints; soak for an hour in salt and water; dip in
beaten egg, then in powdered cracker, and fry brown in
nice sweet lard or dripping. Serve with onion sauce.
Garnish with sliced lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Barbecued Rabbit.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Clean and wash the rabbit, which must be plump and
young, and having opened it all the way on the under-side,
lay it flat, with a small plate or saucer to keep it down, in
salted water for half an hour. Wipe dry and broil whole,
with the exception of the head, when you have gashed
across the back-bone in eight or ten places that the heat
may penetrate this, the thickest part. Your fire should be
hot and clear, the rabbit turned often. When browned
and tender, lay upon a very hot dish, pepper and salt and
butter profusely, turning the rabbit over and over to soak
up the melted butter. Cover and set in the oven for five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
minutes, and heat in a tin cup two tablespoonfuls of vinegar
seasoned with one of made mustard. Anoint the hot
rabbit well with this, cover and send to table garnished
with crisped parsley.</p>

<p>The odor of this barbecue is most appetizing, and the
taste not a whit inferior.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rabbit Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut a pair of rabbits into eight pieces each, soak in
salted water half an hour, and stew until half done in
enough water to cover them. Cut a quarter of a pound
of fat pork into slips, and boil four eggs hard. Lay some
bits of pork in the bottom of a deep dish and upon these
a layer of the rabbit. Upon this spread slices of boiled
egg, peppered and buttered. Sprinkle, moreover, with a
little powdered mace, and squeeze a few drops of lemon-juice
upon each piece of meat. Proceed in this order
until the dish is full, the top layer being pork. Pour in
the water in which the rabbit was boiled, when you have
salted it and added some lumps of butter rolled in flour.
Cover with puff-paste, cut a slit in the middle, and bake
one hour, laying paper over the top should it brown too
fast.</p>



<h3>SQUIRRELS.</h3>

<p>The large gray squirrel is seldom eaten at the North,
but is in great request in Virginia and other Southern
States. It is generally barbecued, precisely as are rabbits;
broiled, fricasseed, or—most popular of all—made into a
Brunswick stew. This is named from Brunswick County,
Virginia, and is a famous dish—or was—at the political
and social pic-nics known as barbecues. I am happy to
be able to give a receipt for this stew that is genuine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
explicit, and for which I am indebted to a Virginia
housekeeper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brunswick Stew.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 squirrels—3, if small.</li>
<li>1 quart of tomatoes—peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>1 pint butter-beans, or Lima.</li>
<li>6 potatoes—parboiled and sliced.</li>
<li>6 ears of green corn cut from the cob.</li>
<li>½ lb. butter.</li>
<li>½ lb. fat salt pork.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful ground black pepper.</li>
<li>Half a teaspoonful cayenne.</li>
<li>1 gallon water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 onion, minced small.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the water with the salt in it, and boil five
minutes. Put in the onion, beans, corn, pork or bacon
cut into shreds, potatoes, pepper, and the squirrels, which
must first be cut into joints and laid in cold salt and
water to draw out the blood. Cover closely and stew two
and a half hours very slowly, stirring frequently from the
bottom. Then add the tomatoes and sugar, and stew an
hour longer. Ten minutes before you take it from the
fire add the butter, cut into bits the size of a walnut,
rolled in flour. Give a final boil, taste to see that it is
seasoned to your liking, and turn into a soup-tureen. It
is eaten from soup-plates. Chickens may be substituted
for squirrels.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Squirrels.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, clean, and quarter a pair of fine young squirrels,
and soak in salt and water to draw out the blood. Slice
an onion and fry brown in a tablespoonful of butter.
Stir into the frying-pan five tablespoonfuls of boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
water, and thicken with two teaspoonfuls of browned
flour. Put the squirrels into a saucepan, with a quarter
of a pound of bacon cut into slips; season with pepper
and salt to taste, add the onion and gravy, and half a
cupful of tepid water. Cover and stew for forty minutes,
or until tender; pour in a glass of wine and the juice of
half a lemon, shake around well, and turn into a deep
covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Squirrels.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and soak to draw out the blood. Wipe dry and
broil over a hot, clear fire, turning often. When done,
lay in a hot dish and anoint with melted butter, seasoned
with pepper and salt. Use at least a tablespoonful for
each squirrel, and let it lie between two hot dishes five
minutes before sending to table.</p>



<h3>PHEASANTS, PARTRIDGES, QUAILS, GROUSE,
ETC.</h3>

<p>The real pheasant is never sold in American markets.
The bird known as such at the South is called a partridge
at the North, and is, properly speaking, the ruffled grouse.
The Northern quail is the English and Southern partridge.
The wild fowls brought by the hundred dozen from the Far
West to Eastern cities, and generally styled prairie-fowls,
are a species of grouse. The mode of cooking all these is
substantially the same.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, truss, and stuff as you do chickens; roast at a
hot fire, and baste with butter and water until brown;
sprinkle with salt, dredge lightly at the last with flour to
froth the birds, and serve hot. Thicken the gravy with
browned flour, boil up, and serve in a boat. Wash the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
inside of all game—prairie-fowls in particular—with soda
and water, rinsing out carefully afterward with fair water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and split down the back. Lay in cold
water half an hour. Wipe carefully, season with salt and
pepper, and broil on a gridiron over a bright fire. When
done, lay in a hot dish, butter on both sides well, and
serve at once.</p>

<p>Broiled quails are delicious and nourishing fare for invalids.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grouse roasted with Bacon.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Clean, truss, and stuff as usual. Cover the entire bird
with thin slices of corned ham or pork, binding all with
buttered pack-thread. Roast three-quarters of an hour,
basting with butter and water three times, then with the
dripping. When quite done, dish with the ham laid
about the body of the bird. Skim the gravy, thicken
with browned flour, season with pepper and the juice of a
lemon. Boil up once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quails roasted with Ham.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Proceed as with the grouse, but cover the ham or pork
with a sheet of white paper, having secured the slices of
meat with pack thread. Stitch the papers on, and keep
them well basted with butter and water, that they may
not burn. Roast three quarters of an hour, if the fire is
good. Remove the papers and meat before sending to
table, and brown quickly. This is the nicest way of
cooking quails.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmi of Game.</span></h3>

<p>Cut cold roast partridges, grouse, or quails into joints,
and lay aside while you prepare the gravy. This is made
of the bones, dressing, skin, and general odds and ends,
after you have selected the neatest pieces of the birds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Put these—the scraps—into a saucepan, with one small
onion, minced, and a bunch of sweet herbs; pour in a pint
of water, and whatever gravy you may have, and stew,
closely covered, for nearly an hour. A few bits of pork
should be added if you have no gravy. Skim and strain,
return to the fire, and add a little brown Sherry and
lemon-juice, with a pinch of nutmeg; thicken with brown
flour, if the stuffing has not thickened it sufficiently, boil
up, and pour over the reserved meat, which should be put
into another saucepan. Warm until all is smoking-hot, but
do not let it boil. Arrange the pieces of bird in a symmetrical
heap upon a dish, and pour the gravy over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Game Pie</span>—(<i>Very fine</i>).</h3>

<p>This may be made of any of the birds named in the
foregoing receipts. Grouse and quails together make a
delightful Christmas pie. Clean and wash the birds; cut
the quails in half, the grouse into four pieces. Trim off
bits of the inferior portions, necks, lower ribs, etc., and
put them with the giblets into a saucepan, with a pint
and a half of water, if your pie requires six birds. While
this is stewing make a good puff-paste and line a large
pudding-dish, reserving enough for a lid half an inch
thick. When the livers are tender, take them out, leaving
the gravy to stew in the covered saucepan. Lard the
breasts of the birds with tiny strips of salt pork, and mince
a couple of slices of the same with the livers, a bunch of
parsley, sweet marjoram, and thyme, also chopped fine,
the juice of a lemon, pepper, and a very small shallot.
Make a force-meat of this, with bread-crumbs moistened
with warm milk. Put some thin strips of cold corned
(not smoked) ham in the bottom of the pie, next to the
crust; lay upon these pieces of the bird, peppered and
buttered, then a layer of the force-meat, and so on, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
you are ready for the gravy. Strain this, return to the
fire, and season with pepper and a glass of wine. Heat
to a boil, pour into the pie, and cover with the upper
crust, cutting a slit in the middle. Ornament with pastry
leaves, arranged in a wreath about the edge, and in the
middle a pastry bird, with curled strips of pastry about
it. This last should be baked separately and laid on when
the pie is done, to cover the hole in the middle.</p>

<p>Bake three hours if your pie be large, covering with
paper if it threaten to brown too fast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quail Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, truss, and stuff the birds. Loosen the joints
with a penknife, but do not separate them. Parboil them
for ten minutes, while you prepare a puff-paste. Line a
deep dish with this; put in the bottom some shreds of salt
pork or ham; next, a layer of hard-boiled eggs, buttered
and peppered; then the birds, sprinkled with pepper and
minced parsley. Squeeze some lemon-juice upon them,
and lay upon the breasts pieces of butter rolled in flour.
Cover with slices of egg, then with shred ham; pour in
some of the gravy in which the quails were parboiled, and
put on the lid, leaving a hole in the middle. Bake over
an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Pigeons.</span> (<i>Stewed.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Clean and wash very carefully, then lay in salt and
water for an hour. Rinse the inside with soda and water,
shaking it well about in the cavity; wash out with fair
water and stuff with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs
and chopped salt pork, seasoned with pepper. Sew up the
birds, and put on to stew in enough cold water to cover
them, and allow to each a fair slice of fat bacon cut into
narrow strips. Season with pepper and a pinch of nutmeg.
Boil slowly in a covered saucepan until tender; take from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the gravy and lay in a covered dish to keep warm.
Strain the gravy, add the juice of a lemon and a tablespoonful
of currant jelly, thickening with browned flour.
Boil up and pour over the pigeons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild-Pigeon Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is made precisely as is quail pie, except that the
pigeons are cut into four pieces each, and not stuffed.
Parboil and lay in the dish in alternate layers with the
bacon and boiled eggs. Make the gravy richer than for
the quails, by the addition of a good lump of butter,
rolled in flour, stirred in and boiled up to thicken before
you put it on the fire. Wild pigeons are usually tougher
and leaner than the tame.</p>



<h3>WILD DUCKS.</h3>

<p>Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a fishy flavor,
and when handled by inexperienced cooks, are sometimes
uneatable from this cause. Before roasting them, guard
against this by parboiling them with a small carrot, peeled,
put within each. This will absorb the unpleasant taste.
An onion will have the same effect; but, unless you mean
to use onion in the stuffing, the carrot is preferable. In
my own kitchen I usually put in the onion, considering a
suspicion of garlic a desideratum in roast duck, whether
wild or tame.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Duck.</span> (<i>Wild.</i>)</h3>

<p>Parboil as above directed; throw away the carrot or
onion, lay in fresh water half an hour; stuff with bread-crumbs
seasoned with pepper, salt, sage, and onion, and
roast until brown and tender, basting for half the time
with butter and water, then with the drippings. Add to
the gravy, when you have taken up the ducks, a tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of currant jelly, and a pinch of cayenne.
Thicken with browned flour and serve in a tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Ducks.</span> (<i>Stewed.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Parboil ten minutes, when you have drawn them, and
put in a raw carrot or onion. Lay in very cold water half
an hour. Cut into joints, pepper, salt, and flour them.
Have ready some butter in a frying-pan, and fry them a
light brown. Put them in a saucepan and cover with
gravy made of the giblets, necks, and some bits of lean
veal. Add a minced shallot, a bunch of sweet herbs, salt,
and pepper. Cover closely and stew half an hour, or
until tender. Take out the duck, strain the gravy when
you have skimmed it; put in a half-cup of cream or rich
milk in which an egg has been beaten, thicken with
browned flour, add a tablespoonful of wine and the juice
of half a lemon, beaten in gradually not to curdle the
cream; boil up and pour over the ducks. This is about
the best way of cooking wild ducks.</p>



<h3>WILD TURKEY.</h3>

<p>This stately stalker of Southern forests and Western
prairies is eagerly sought after by the lovers of good
eating in those regions. The dark meat and game flavor
proclaim his birthright of lordly freedom as truly after he
is slain and cooked, as did his lithe grace of figure, lofty
carriage, and bright eye while he trod his native wilds. I
have heard sportsmen declare that when they have inveigled
him up to a blind by imitating the call of his harem
or younglings, they have stood in covert, gun at shoulder
and finger on the trigger, spell-bound by pitying admiration
of his beauty. But I have never seen that sensibility
curbed appetite while they told the story at the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
adorned by the royal bird; have noted, indeed, that their
mouths watered rather than their eyes, as he crumbled,
like a dissolving view, under the blade of the carver.</p>

<p>Draw and wash the inside very carefully, as with all
game. Domestic fowls are, or should be, kept up without
eating for at least twelve hours before they are killed; but
we must shoot wild when we can get the chance, and
of course it often happens that their crops are distended
by a recent hearty meal of rank or green food. Wipe the
cavity with a dry soft cloth before you stuff. Have a rich
force-meat, bread-crumbs, some bits of fat pork, chopped
fine, pepper, and salt. Beat in an egg and a couple of
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Baste with butter and
water for the first hour, then three or four times with the
gravy; lastly, five or six times with melted butter. A
generous and able housekeeper told me once that she
always allowed a pound of butter for basting a large wild
turkey. This was an extravagant quantity, but the meat
is drier than that of the domestic fowl, and not nearly so
fat. Dredge with flour at the last, froth with butter, and
when he is of a tempting brown, serve. Skim the gravy,
add a little hot water, pepper, thicken with the giblets
chopped fine and browned flour, boil up, and pour into a
tureen. At the South the giblets are not put in the
gravy, but laid whole, one under each wing, when the
turkey is dished. Garnish with small fried sausages, not
larger than a dollar, crisped parsley between them.</p>

<p>Send around currant jelly and cranberry sauce with it.</p>



<h3>SMALL BIRDS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Snipe or Plovers.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and truss, but do not stuff. Lay in rows in the
dripping-pan, or tie upon a spit, sprinkle with salt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
baste well with butter, then with butter and water. When
they begin to brown, which will be in about ten minutes,
cut as many rounds of bread (without crust) as there are
birds. Toast quickly, butter, and lay in the dripping-pan,
a bird upon each. When the birds are done, serve upon
the toast, with the gravy poured over it. The toast should
lie under them while cooking at least five minutes, during
which time the birds should be basted with melted butter
seasoned with pepper.</p>

<p>The largest snipe will not require above twenty
minutes to roast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Woodcock.</span></h3>

<p>This is the most delicious of small birds, and may be
either roasted or broiled.</p>


<h3><i>Roast.</i></h3>

<p>The English do not draw woodcock, regarding the <i>trail</i>
as a <i>bonne bouche</i>, and I have known American housekeepers
who copied them in this respect. In this case
roast precisely as you would snipe or plover, only putting
the toast under the birds so soon as they begin to cook, to
catch the trail.</p>

<p>To my taste, a better, and certainly to common sense
people a less objectionable plan, is to fill the birds with a
rich force-meat of bread-crumbs, peppered and salted,
shortened with melted butter. Sew them up and roast,
basting with butter and water, from twenty minutes to
half an hour. When half done, put circular slices of
buttered toast beneath, and serve upon these when you
take them up.</p>


<h3><i>Broiled.</i></h3>

<p>Split down the back, and broil over a clear fire. Butter,
pepper, and salt when done, and let them lie between two
hot dishes for five minutes before sending to table. Small
snipe are nice broiled in this way; also robins and doves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmi of Woodcock or Snipe.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and half-roast the birds; cut in quarters, and
put in a saucepan with gravy made of the giblets, necks,
and some bits of fat pork, stewed in a little water. Add
a minced button onion, salt, and a pinch of cayenne, and
stew fifteen minutes or until tender, closely covered. Take
out the birds, and pile neatly upon buttered toast in a
chafing-dish. Strain the gravy and return to the fire,
adding some small pieces of butter rolled in flour, the
juice of a lemon and a little wine. Boil up, and pour
over the salmi.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ortolans, Reed-Birds, Rail, and Sora</span></h3>

<p>may be roasted or broiled. A good way is to roll an oyster
in melted butter, then in bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper
and salt, and put into each bird before roasting.
Baste with butter and water three times, put the rounds
of toast underneath, and baste freely with melted butter.
They will require about twenty minutes to cook, and will
be found delicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Keep Game from Tainting.</span></h3>

<p>Draw so soon as they come into your possession; rinse
with soda and water, then with pure cold water; wipe dry,
and rub them lightly with a mixture of fine salt and
black pepper. If you must keep them some time, put in
the cavity of each fowl a piece of charcoal; hang them
in a cool, dark place, with a cloth thrown over them.
Small birds, unless there are too many of them, may be
kept in a refrigerator after you have drawn, washed, and
wiped them.</p>

<p>The charcoal is an admirable preventive of decomposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="SAUCES_FOR_MEAT_AND_FISH"></a>SAUCES FOR MEAT AND FISH.</h3>

<p>These are no longer the appendages of the rich man’s
bill of fare only. A general knowledge of made sauces,
as well as the more expensive ones imported from abroad
and sold here at high prices, is a part of every intelligent
housekeeper’s culinary education. Few are so ignorant as
to serve a fish sauce with game, or <i>vice versâ</i>. From the
immense number of receipts which I have collected and
examined, I have selected comparatively few but such as
I consider “representative” articles. The ingenious housewife
is at liberty, as I said before, elsewhere, to modify
and improve upon them.</p>

<p>First, <i>par excellence</i>, as the most important, and because
it is the groundwork of many others, I place</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Melted or Drawn Butter.</span></h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">No. 1.</span></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls flour.</li>
<li>1½ ounce butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful hot water or milk.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the flour and salt in a bowl, and add a little at a
time of the water or milk, working it very smooth as you
go on. Put into a tin cup or saucepan, and set in a vessel
of boiling water. As it warms, stir, and when it has boiled
a minute or more, add the butter by degrees, stirring all
the time until it is entirely melted and incorporated with
the flour and water. Boil one minute.</p>

<p>Mix with milk when you wish to use for puddings,
with water for meats and fish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">No. 2.</span></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1½ teaspoonful of flour.</li>
<li>2 ounces butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful (small) hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Wet the flour to a thin smooth paste with cold water,
and stir into the hot, which should be in the inner vessel.
When it boils, add the butter by degrees, and stir until
well mixed. Boil one minute.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">No. 3.</span></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 ounces butter.</li>
<li>Half-pint water (hot).</li>
<li>A beaten egg.</li>
<li>1 heaping teaspoonful flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wet the flour to a smooth paste with a little cold milk,
and add to the hot water in the inner vessel, stirring until
thick. Have ready the beaten egg in a cup. Take a teaspoonful
of the mixture from the fire, and beat with this
until light; then another, and still another. Set aside the
cup when this is done, and stir the butter into the contents
of the inner saucepan gradually, until thoroughly
mixed, then add the beaten egg in the same way. There
is no danger of clotting the egg, if it be treated as I have
described.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Egg_Sauce"></a>Egg Sauce.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>A good teacupful drawn butter.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the yolks only of the eggs very fine, and beat
into the hot drawn butter, salting to taste.</p>

<p>This is used for boiled fowls and boiled fish. For the
former, you can add some minced parsley; for the latter,
chopped pickles, capers, or nasturtium seed. For boiled
beef, a small shallot minced fine.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Omit the boiled eggs, and beat up two raw ones very
light, and put into the drawn butter instead, as directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in No. 3. For boiled beef or chicken, you may make the
drawn butter of hot liquor taken from the pot in which
the meat is cooking, having first carefully skimmed it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce for Boiled or Baked Fish.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 ounces butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful flour.</li>
<li>2 anchovies.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful chopped capers, or nasturtium seed, or green pickle.</li>
<li>1 shallot.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teacupful hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the water into the inner saucepan, chop the anchovies
and shallot, and put in with the pepper and salt. Boil
two minutes, and strain back into the saucepan when you
have rinsed with hot water. Now add the flour wet
smooth with cold water, and stir until it thickens; put in
the butter by degrees, and when it is thoroughly melted
and mixed, the vinegar; lastly, the capers and a little
nutmeg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Sauce for Fish.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make drawn butter by receipt No. 2, but with double
the quantity of flour, and use, instead of water, the liquor
in which the fish was boiled. Add four tablespoonfuls of
milk, in which a shallot and a head of celery or a pinch
of celery-seed has been boiled, then strained out. Boil
one minute, and stir in a teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Sauce.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint oysters.</li>
<li>Half a lemon.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful flour.</li>
<li>1 teacupful milk or cream.</li>
<li>Cayenne and nutmeg to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the oysters in their own liquor five minutes, and
add the milk. When this boils, strain the liquor and
return to the saucepan. Thicken with the flour when
you have wet it with cold water; stir it well in; put in
the butter, next the cayenne (if you like it), boil one
minute; squeeze in the lemon-juice, shake it around well,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Drain the oysters dry without cooking at all; make the
sauce with the liquor and other ingredients just named.
Chop the raw oysters, and stir in when you do the butter;
boil five minutes, and pour into the tureen. Some put in
the oysters whole, considering that the sauce is handsomer
than when they are chopped.</p>

<p>Oyster sauce is used for boiled halibut, cod, and other
fish, for boiled turkey, chickens, and white meats generally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crab Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 crab, boiled and cold.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
<li>1 teacupful drawn butter.</li>
<li>Cayenne, mace, and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make the drawn butter as usual, and stir in the milk.
Pick the meat from the crab, chop very fine, season with
cayenne, mace, and salt to taste; stir into the drawn butter.
Simmer three minutes, but do not boil.</p>

<p>Lobster sauce is very nice made as above, with the
addition of a teaspoonful of made mustard and the juice of
half a lemon. This is a good fish sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Anchovy Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 anchovies.</li>
<li>A teacupful drawn butter.</li>
<li>A wineglass pale Sherry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the anchovies in cold water two hours; pull them
to pieces, and simmer in just enough water to cover them
for half an hour. Strain the liquor into the drawn butter
(No. 3), boil a minute, add the wine; heat gradually to a
boil, and stew five minutes longer. You may substitute
two teaspoonfuls of anchovy paste for the little fish themselves.</p>

<p>Serve with boiled fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce for Lobsters.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls fresh butter.</li>
<li>Teacupful vinegar.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste, with a heaping teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>Minced parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the butter to a cream, adding gradually the vinegar,
salt, and pepper. Boil a bunch of parsley five
minutes, chop small; beat into the butter; lastly the sugar
and mustard. The butter must be light as whipped egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Bread_Sauce"></a>Bread Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint milk.</li>
<li>1 cup bread-crumbs (very fine).</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced.</li>
<li>A pinch of mace.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer the sliced onion in the milk until tender; strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the milk and pour over the bread-crumbs, which should
be put into a saucepan. Cover and soak half an hour;
beat smooth with an egg-whip, add the seasoning and
butter; stir in well, boil up once, and serve in a tureen.
If it is too thick, add boiling water and more butter.</p>

<p>This sauce is for roast poultry. Some people add some
of the gravy from the dripping-pan, first straining it and
beating it well in with the sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Celery Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 large heads of celery.</li>
<li>1 teacupful of broth in which the fowl is boiled.</li>
<li>1 teacupful cream or milk.</li>
<li>Salt and nutmeg.</li>
<li>Heaping tablespoonful flour, and same of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the celery tender in salted water; drain, and cut
into bits half an inch long. Thicken the gravy from the
fowl—a teacupful—with the flour; add the butter, salt,
and nutmeg, then the milk. Stir and beat until it is
smooth; put in the celery; heat almost to boiling, stirring
all the while; serve in a tureen, or, if you prefer, pour it
over the boiled meat or fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Onion Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 white onions.</li>
<li>1 teacupful hot milk.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel the onions, boil tender, press the water from them,
and mince fine. Have ready the hot milk in a saucepan;
stir in the onions, then the butter, salt, and pepper. Boil
up once.</p>

<p>If you want to have it particularly good, make nice
melted or drawn butter (No. 3); beat the mashed onion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
into it; add a teacupful of cream or new milk, season,
boil up, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maître d’Hôtel Sauce.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 teacupful drawn butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful minced parsley.</li>
<li>1 lemon.</li>
<li>Cayenne and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Draw the butter (No. 2); boil the parsley three minutes;
take it out and lay in cold water five minutes, to
cool; chop and stir into the butter; squeeze in the lemon-juice,
the pepper and salt; beat hard with an egg-whip,
return to the fire, and boil up once.</p>

<p>This is a “stock” sauce, being suitable for so many
dishes, roast or boiled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mint Sauce for Roast Lamb.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls green mint, chopped fine.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Half a teacupful cider vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the mint, put the sugar and vinegar in a sauce
boat, and stir in the mint. Let it stand in a cool place
fifteen minutes before sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 teacupful young mushrooms.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful cream or milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful flour.</li>
<li>Nutmeg, mace, and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the mushrooms in barely enough water to cover
them until tender. Drain, but do not press them, and add
the cream, butter, and seasoning. Stew over a bright fire,
stirring all the while until it begins to thicken. Add the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
flour wet in cold milk, boil up and serve in a boat, or
pour over boiled chickens, rabbits, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 small cauliflower.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls butter, cut in bits, and rolled in flour.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 small head of celery.</li>
<li>Mace, pepper, and salt.</li>
<li>1 teacupful water.</li>
<li>1 teacupful milk or cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the cauliflower in two waters, changing when about
half done, and throwing away the first, reserve a teacupful
of the last. Take out the cauliflower, drain and mince.
Cook in another saucepan the onion and celery, mincing
them when tender. Heat the reserved cupful of water
again in a saucepan, add the milk; when warm put in the
cauliflower and onion, the butter and seasoning—coating
the butter thickly with flour; boil until it thickens.</p>

<p>This is a delicious sauce for boiled corned beef and
mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>A dozen heads of asparagus.</li>
<li>2 teacupfuls drawn butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>The juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>Salt and white pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the tender heads in a very little salted water. Drain
and chop them. Have ready a pint of drawn butter, with
two raw eggs beaten into it; add the asparagus, and
season, squeezing in the lemon-juice last. The butter must
be hot, but do not cook after putting in the asparagus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
heads. This accompanies boiled fowls, stewed fillet of
veal, or boiled mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice some ripe tart apples, stew in
water enough to cover them until they break to pieces.
Beat up to a smooth pulp, stir in a good lump of butter,
and sugar to taste.</p>

<p>Apple sauce is the invariable accompaniment of roast
pork—or fresh pork cooked in any way. If you wish,
you can add a little nutmeg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of dried peaches in water four hours.
Wash them, rubbing them against one another by stirring
around with a wooden spoon. Drain, and put into a
saucepan with just enough water to cover them. Stew
until they break to pieces. Rub to a soft smooth pulp,
sweeten to taste with white sugar. Send to table cold,
with roast game or other meats.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pick a quart of ripe cranberries, and put
into a saucepan with a teacupful of water. Stew slowly,
stirring often until they are thick as marmalade. They
require at least an hour and a half to cook. When you
take them from the fire, sweeten abundantly with white
sugar. If sweetened while cooking, the color will be bad.
Put them into a mould and set aside to get cold.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>And this is a nicer plan—strain the pulp through a cullender
or sieve, or coarse mosquito-net, into a mould wet
with cold water. When firm, turn into a glass dish or
salver. Be sure that it is sweet enough.</p>

<p>Eat with roast turkey, game, and roast ducks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Brown Flour.</span></h3>

<p>Spread upon a tin plate, set upon the stove, or in a <i>very</i>
hot oven, and stir continually after it begins to color,
until it is brown all through.</p>

<p>Keep it always on hand. Make it at odd minutes, and
put away in a glass jar, covered closely. Shake up every
few days to keep it light and prevent lumping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Brown Butter.</span></h3>

<p>Put a lump of butter into a hot frying-pan, and toss it
around over a clear fire until it browns. Dredge
browned flour over it, and stir to a smooth batter until it
begins to boil. Use it for coloring gravies, such as brown
fricassees, etc.; or make into sauce for baked fish and fish-steaks,
by beating in celery or onion vinegar, a <i>very</i> little
brown sugar and some cayenne.</p>



<h3>CATSUPS AND FLAVORED VINEGARS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Made Mustard.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls best English mustard.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white pepper.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li>Vinegar to mix to a smooth paste—celery or Tarragon vinegar if you have it.</li>
<li>1 small garlic, minced very small.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the mustard in a bowl and wet with the oil, rubbing
it in with a silver or wooden spoon until it is absorbed.
Wet with vinegar to a stiff paste; add salt,
pepper, sugar, and garlic, and work all together thoroughly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wetting little by little with the vinegar until you
can beat it as you do cake-batter. Beat five minutes very
hard; put into wide-mouthed bottles—empty French
mustard bottles, if you have them—pour a little oil on
top, cork tightly, and set away in a cool place. It will
be mellow enough for use in a couple of days.</p>

<p>Having used this mustard for years in my own family,
I can safely advise my friends to undertake the trifling
labor of preparing it in consideration of the satisfaction
to be derived from the condiment. I mix in a Wedgewood
mortar, with pestle of the same; but a bowl is nearly as
good. It will keep for weeks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Horse-radish.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape or grind, cover with vinegar, and keep in wide-mouthed
bottles. To eat with roast beef and cold meats.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Walnut Catsup.</span></h3>

<p>Choose young walnuts tender enough to be pierced with
a pin or needle. Prick them in several places, and lay in
a jar with a handful of salt to every twenty-five, and
water enough to cover them. Break them with a billet of
wood or wooden beetle, and let them lie in the pickle a
fortnight, stirring twice a day. Drain off the liquor into
a saucepan, and cover the shells with boiling vinegar to
extract what juice remains in them. Crush to a pulp
and strain through a cullender into the saucepan. Allow
for every quart an ounce of black pepper and one of
ginger, half an ounce of cloves and half an ounce of nutmeg,
beaten fine. Put in a pinch of cayenne, a shallot
minced fine for every <i>two</i> quarts, and a thimbleful of
celery-seed tied in a bag for the same quantity. Boil all
together for an hour, if there be a gallon of the mixture.
Bottle when cold, putting an equal quantity of the spice
in each flask. Butternuts make delightful catsup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom Catsup.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 quarts of mushrooms.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lay in an earthenware pan, in alternate layers of mushrooms
and salt; let them lie six hours, then break into bits.
Set in a cool place, three days, stirring thoroughly every
morning. Measure the juice when you have strained it,
and to every quart allow half an ounce of allspice, the same
quantity of ginger, half a teaspoonful of powdered mace, a
teaspoonful of cayenne. Put into a stone jar, cover closely,
set in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and boil
five hours <i>hard</i>. Take it off, empty into a porcelain kettle,
and boil slowly half an hour longer. Let it stand all
night in a cool place, until settled and clear. Pour off
carefully from the sediment, and bottle, filling the flasks
to the mouth. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and tie up
with bladders.</p>

<p>The bottles should be very small, as it soon spoils when
exposed to the air.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitation Worcestershire Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 teaspoonfuls cayenne pepper.</li>

<li>3 shallots minced fine.</li>
<li>3 anchovies chopped into bits.</li>
<li>1 quart of vinegar.</li>
<li>Half-teaspoonful powdered cloves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and rub through a sieve. Put in a stone jar, set in
a pot of boiling water, and heat until the liquid is so hot
you can not bear your finger in it. Strain, and let it stand
in the jar, closely covered, two days, then bottle for use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<li>1 tablespoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cayenne pepper, and same of mace.</li>
<li>1 teacupful cider vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teacupful sherry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the oysters and boil in their own liquor with a
teacupful of vinegar, skimming the scum as it rises. Boil
three minutes, strain through a hair-cloth; return the
liquor to the fire, add the wine, pepper, salt, and mace.
Boil fifteen minutes, and when cold bottle for use, sealing
the corks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Catsup.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 peck ripe tomatoes.</li>
<li>1 ounce salt.</li>
<li>1 ounce mace.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful black pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cayenne.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful cloves (powdered).</li>
<li>7 tablespoonful ground mustard.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful celery seed (tied in a thin muslin bag).</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut a slit in the tomatoes, put into a bell-metal or porcelain
kettle, and boil until the juice is all extracted and
the pulp dissolved. Strain and press through a cullender,
then through a hair sieve. Return to the fire, add the
seasoning, and boil <i>at least</i> five hours, stirring constantly
for the last hour, and frequently throughout the time it is
on the fire. Let it stand twelve hours in a stone jar on
the cellar floor. When cold, add a pint of strong vinegar.

<p>Tomato and walnut are the most useful catsups we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for general purposes, and either is in itself a fine sauce for
roast meat, cold fowl, game, etc.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>12 large, fresh lemons.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls white mustard-seed.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful turmeric.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cloves.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mace.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful cayenne.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls grated horse-radish.</li>
<li>1 shallot, minced fine.</li>
<li>Juice of the lemons.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls table-salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grate the rind of the lemons; pound or grind the
spices, and put all together, including the horse-radish.
Strew the salt over all, add the lemon-juice, and let it
stand three hours in a cool place. Boil in a porcelain kettle
half an hour. Pour into a covered vessel—china or

<h3>SALADS.</h3>

<p>“The dressing of the salad should be saturated with
oil, and seasoned with pepper and salt before the vinegar
is added. It results from this process that there never
can be too much vinegar; for, from the specific gravity of
the vinegar compared with oil, what is more than useful
will fall to the bottom of the bowl. The salt should not
be dissolved in the vinegar, but in the oil, by which means
it is more equally distributed throughout the salad.”—<i>Chaptal,
a French chemist.</i></p>

<p>The Spanish proverb says, “that to make a perfect salad,
there should be a miser for oil, a spendthrift for vinegar,
a wise man for salt, and a madcap to stir the ingredients
up and mix them well together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>At least twenty-five years ago I pasted the above doggerel
in my scrap-book, and committed it to memory.
The first salad I was ever trusted to compound was dressed
in strict obedience to the directions of the witty divine,
and to this day these seem to me pertinent and worthy of
note. The anchovy sauce can be omitted if you like, and
a spoonful of Harvey’s or Worcestershire substituted.
This is best suited for chicken or turkey salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pick out every bit of the meat from the body and claws of
a cold boiled lobster. Lay aside the coral for the dressing,
and mince the rest. For the dressing you will
need—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 eggs, boiled hard.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cayenne pepper. <i>Vinegar at discretion.</i></li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of Harvey’s, Worcestershire, or anchovy sauce.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the yolks to a smooth paste in a mortar or bowl,
with a Wedgewood pestle, a silver or wooden spoon, until
<i>perfectly</i> free from lumps. Add gradually, rubbing all the
while, the other ingredients, the coral last. This should
have been worked well upon a plate with a silver knife or
wooden spatula. Proceed slowly and carefully in the
work of amalgamating the various ingredients, moistening
with vinegar as they stiffen. Increase the quantity of
this as the mixture grows smooth, until it is thin enough
to pour over the minced lobster. You will need a teacupful
at least. Toss with a silver fork and do not break the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
meat. Some mix chopped lettuce with the salad; but
unless it is to be eaten within a few minutes, the vinegar
will wither the tender leaves. The better plan is to heap
a glass dish with the inner leaves of several lettuce-heads,
laying pounded ice among them, and pass with the lobster,
that the guests may add the green salad to their
taste.</p>

<p>When lettuce is out of season, the following dressing,
the receipt for which was given me by a French gourmand,
may be used.</p>

<p>Prepare the egg and coral as above, with the condiments
there mentioned, but mix with the lobster-meat four tablespoonfuls
of fine white cabbage, chopped small, with two
small onions, also minced into almost invisible bits, a
teaspoonful of anchovy or other sauce, and a tablespoonful
of celery vinegar.</p>

<p>All lobster salad should be eaten as soon as possible
after the dressing is added, else it becomes unwholesome.
If you use canned lobster, open and turn out the contents
of the can into a china dish several hours before you mix
the dressing, that the close, airless smell may pass away.</p>

<p>Garnish the edges of the dish with cool white leaves of
curled lettuce, or with a chain of rings made of the whites
of the boiled eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Excelsior Lobster Salad with Cream Dressing.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 fine lobster, boiled and when cold picked to pieces, or two small ones.</li>
<li>1 cup of best salad oil.</li>
<li>½ cup sweet cream, whipped light to a cupful of froth.</li>
<li>1 lemon—the juice strained.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mustard wet up with vinegar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></li>
<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls vinegar.</li>
<li>Beaten yolks of two eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, sugar, salt, mustard, and pepper until light;
then, and very gradually, the oil. When the mixture is
quite thick, whip in the lemon. Beat five minutes before
putting in the vinegar. Just before the salad goes to
table add half the whipped cream to this dressing and
stir well into the lobster. Line the salad-bowl with lettuce-leaves;
put in the seasoned meat and cover with the
rest of the whipped cream.</p>

<p>This salad deserves its name.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>The white meat of a cold boiled or roasted chicken (or turkey).</li>
<li>Three-quarters the same bulk of chopped celery.</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>1 raw egg, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>3 teaspoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls  white sugar.</li>
<li>½ teacupful of vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the meat well, removing every scrap of fat, gristle,
and skin; cut the celery into bits half an inch long,
<i>or less</i>, mix them, and set aside in a cold place while you
prepare the dressing.</p>

<p>Rub the yolks of the eggs to a fine powder, add the
salt, pepper, and sugar, then the oil, grinding hard, and
putting in but a few drops at a time. The mustard comes
next, and let all stand together while you whip the raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
egg to a froth. Beat this into the dressing, and pour in
the vinegar spoonful by spoonful, whipping the dressing
well as you do it. Sprinkle a little dry salt over the meat
and celery; toss it up lightly with a silver fork; pour the
dressing over it, tossing and mixing until the bottom of
the mass is as well saturated as the top; turn into the
salad-bowl, and garnish with white of eggs (boiled)
cut into rings or flowers, and sprigs of bleached celery-tops.</p>

<p>If you cannot get celery, substitute crisp white cabbage,
and use celery vinegar in the dressing. You can also, in
this case, chop some green pickles, gherkins, mangoes, or
cucumbers, and stir in.</p>

<p>Turkey makes even better salad than chicken.</p>

<p>You can make soup of the liquor in which the fowl is
cooked, since it need not be boiled in a cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Two or three heads white lettuce.</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the yolks to a powder, add sugar, pepper, salt,
mustard, and oil. Let it stand five minutes, and beat in
the vinegar. Cut the lettuce up with a knife and fork,—a
chopper would bruise it,—put into a bowl, add the dressing,
and mix by tossing with a silver fork.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can dress on the table with oil and vinegar only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pulling the heart of the lettuce out with your fingers, and
seasoning to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 heads of lettuce.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls green mustard leaves.</li>
<li>A handful of water-cresses.</li>
<li>Four or five very tender radishes.</li>
<li>1 cucumber.</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teacupful vinegar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls salad oil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the dressing as for lettuce salad. Cut up the
hearts of the lettuce, the radishes and cucumber, into very
small pieces; chop the mustard and cress. Pour over
these the dressing, tossing very lightly, not to bruise the
young leaves; heap in a salad-bowl upon a lump of ice,
and garnish with fennel-heads and nasturtium-blossoms.</p>

<p>This is a delightful accompaniment to boiled or baked
fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Water-cresses.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pick over the cresses carefully, pluck from
the stems, and pile in the salad bowl, with a dressing of
vinegar, pepper, salt, and sugar, well stirred in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad, or Cold Slaw.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 head of fine white cabbage, minced fine.</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teacupful vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix as for lettuce and pour upon the chopped cabbage.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i> ✠</h3>

<p>Shred the head of cabbage fine, and dress with—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup vinegar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls sour cream.</li>
<li>A pinch of pepper, and the same of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the vinegar, with all the ingredients for the dressing,
except the cream, in a saucepan, and let them come
to a boil. Pour while scalding over the cabbage, and set
away until perfectly cold. Add the cream just before
serving, stirring in with a silver fork.</p>

<p>This is a very nice preparation of cabbage, and far more
wholesome than the uncooked. Try it!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>12 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>4 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>1 raw egg, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>¼ spoonful cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salad oil.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teacupful vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the yolks to a smooth paste, adding by degrees the
salt, pepper, sugar, mustard, and oil. Beat the raw egg to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a froth and stir in—lastly the vinegar. Peel the tomatoes,
slice them a quarter of an inch thick, and set the dish on
ice, while you are making ready the dressing. Stir a great
lump of ice rapidly in this—the dressing—until it is cold;
take it out, cover the tomatoes with the mixture, and set
back on the ice until you send to table.</p>

<p>This salad is delicious, especially when ice-cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Celery_Salad"></a>Celery Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 boiled egg.</li>
<li>1 raw egg.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salad oil.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare the dressing as for tomato salad; cut the celery
into bits half an inch long, and season. Eat at once,
before the vinegar injures the crispness of the vegetable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Salad.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1½ lb. cold boiled or baked salmon.</li>
<li>2 heads white lettuce (or celery).</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls salad oil.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt, and same of cayenne.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful  white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful Worcestershire or anchovy sauce.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teacupful vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince three-quarters of the salmon, laying aside four or
five pieces half an inch wide and four or five long; cut
smoothly and of uniform size. Prepare the dressing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the usual way, and pour over the minced fish. Shred the
lettuce, handling as little as possible, and heap in a separate
bowl, with pounded ice. This must accompany the
salmon, that the guests may help themselves to their
liking. Or you may mix the lettuce with the fish, if it is
to be eaten immediately. Celery, of course, is always
stirred into the salad, when it is used. The reserved
pieces of salmon should be laid in the dressing for five
minutes before the latter is added to the minced fish, then
dipped in vinegar. When you have transferred your
salad (or mayonnaise) to the dish in which it is to be
served, round it into a mound, and lay the strips upon it
in such a manner as to divide it into triangular sections,
the bars all meeting at the top and diverging at the base.
Between these have subdivisions of chain-work made of
the whites of the boiled eggs, each circle overlapping that
next to it.</p>

<p>You can dress halibut in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Salad.</span> ✠ (<i>Very good.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 cups of mashed potato, rubbed through a cullender.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of chopped cabbage—white and firm.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls cucumber pickle, also chopped.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, pounded fine.</li>
<li>Mix all well together.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>Dressing.</i></h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 raw egg, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of celery-seed.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of flour.</li>
<li>½ cupful of vinegar.</li>
<li>Salt, mustard, and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the vinegar and pour it upon the beaten egg, sugar,
butter, and seasoning. Wet the flour with cold vinegar,
and beat into this. Cook the mixture, stirring until it
thickens, when pour, scalding hot, upon the salad. Toss
with a silver fork, and let it get very cold before eating.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Salad, or Mock Crab.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ lb. pickled shrimps.</li>
<li>¼ lb. good old cheese.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salad oil.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls celery or onion vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the shrimps and grate the cheese. Work into
the latter, a little at a time, the various condiments enumerated
above, the vinegar last. Let all stand together
ten minutes before adding the shrimps. When this is
done, stir well for a minute and a half and serve in a
glass dish, garnished with lemon, or (if you can get one)
in a clean crab-shell.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ lb. old cheese, grated.</li>
<li>1 hard-boiled egg.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cayenne.</li>

<li>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful onion vinegar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salad oil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the yolk of the egg to a paste with the oil, adding
in order the salt, pepper, sugar, and mustard, lastly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
cheese. Work all well together before putting in the
vinegar. Serve in a crab-shell.</p>

<p>These mixtures bear a marvellous resemblance in taste
to devilled crab, and make a good impromptu relish at tea
or luncheon. Eat with crackers and butter. This is still
better if you add a cupful of cold minced chicken.</p>

<p>Use none but the best and freshest olive salad oil (<i>not</i>
sweet oil, falsely so called) in compounding your salad-dressing.
If you cannot obtain this, melted butter is the
best substitute I know of.</p>

<h3>POTATOES.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Boiled Potatoes</span> (<i>with the skins on.</i>)</h4>

<p>Boil in cold water with a pinch of salt. Have them of
uniform size, and cook steadily until a fork will pierce
easily to the heart of the largest. Then pour off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
water, every drop; sprinkle with salt and set back on the
range, a little to one side, with the lid of the pot off. Let
them dry three or four minutes; peel very quickly and
serve in an uncovered dish.</p>


<h4><i>Without the Skins.</i></h4>

<p>Pare very thin. The glory of a potato is its mealiness,
and much of the starch, or meal, lies next the skin—consequently
is lost by slovenly paring, which likewise defaces
the shape. Lay in cold water for half an hour, have
ready a pot of boiling water slightly salted, drop in the
potatoes, and keep at a rapid boil until tender. Drain off
the water, sprinkle with fine salt, and dry as just described.</p>

<p>And here comes a conflict of authorities. Says my kind
friend and neighbor, Mrs. A., an excellent housewife—“I
boil my potatoes in cold water always—with a pinch of
salt, of course, and when half-done, throw away the boiling
water and fill up with cold, then boil again. This
makes the potatoes mealy.” Mrs. B., whose reputation as
a housekeeper and cook is in every kitchen, interposes:—“I
have tried both ways. My experience is that potatoes
melt into a sort of starchy gruel when boiled in cold
water. The philosophy of the operation is to heat quickly
and thoroughly, and, the instant they are done, to dry
out every drop of water. And—” with a touch of pardonable
pride—“we generally have delightful potatoes.”
This is true, but remembering that Mrs. A.’s are like
snow hillocks, ready to crumble at a breath, I come
home and try the cold water plan. My cook, unlike
most of her tribe, is too sensible to suppose that she
knows everything, and willingly abets me. The result
of our experiments stands somewhat thus—Garnet, White
Mountain, and Early Rose potatoes <i>are</i> apt to dissolve in
cold water, giving off their starch too readily, perhaps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
We boil them in hot water. Peach Blows, Prince Alberts,
and other late varieties are best cooked as Mrs. A.
recommends—<i>always</i> pouring off the water the instant
they are done, and letting the potatoes dry for a few
minutes. My housewifely friends can decide for themselves
which method is preferable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Old potatoes are best mashed. Pare, and let them lie
in cold water from half to three-quarters of an hour. A
longer time will not hurt them. Boil in hot or cold
water, according to the toughness of texture. A coarse,
waxy potato is best cooked in cold water. In either
case, put in a pinch of salt. Drain thoroughly when
done, sprinkle with salt, and mash them in the pot with
a potato-beetle, or whip with a split spoon, working in a
tablespoonful of butter and enough milk to make the
paste about the consistency of soft dough. Leave no
lumps in it, and when smooth, dish. Form into a mound
with a wooden spoon, and leave dots of pepper here and
there on the surface, as large as a half-dime.</p>


<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p class='unindent'>Brown by setting in the oven until a crust is formed.
Glaze this with butter, and serve.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Boil New Potatoes.</span></h4>

<p>If very young, rub the skin off with a rough towel. If
almost ripe, scrape with a blunt knife. Lay in cold
water an hour, cover with cold water slightly salted, boil
half an hour. Drain, salt, and dry for two or three
minutes. Send to table plain.</p>


<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p class='unindent'>You may crack each by pressing lightly upon it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
back of a wooden spoon, lay them in a deep dish, and pour
over them a cupful of cream or new milk, heated to a boil,
in which a great spoonful of butter has been dissolved.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Stew Old Potatoes.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>This is a good way to cook potatoes which are so rank
and tough as hardly to be eatable in any other form.</p>

<p>Pare and quarter, if large. Soak in cold water one
hour. Put into a pot with enough cold salted water to
cover them. When almost done, turn off the water, add
a like quantity of milk, and bring to a boil. Before
taking up, stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a
little salt, a handful of chopped parsley, and thicken
slightly with flour previously wet in cold milk. Boil
one minute, and pour all into a deep dish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes for Breakfast.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Pare, cut into dice, and soak in cold water half an
hour. Stew in enough hot salted water to cover them.
Before taking up, and when they are breaking to pieces,
drain off half the water, and pour in a cupful of milk.
Boil three minutes, stirring well; put in a lump of butter
the size of an egg rolled in flour, a little salt and a pinch
of pepper; add a little parsley; boil up well and turn into
a covered dish.</p>

<p>This is an excellent family dish. Children are usually
fond of it and it is very wholesome.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h4>

<p>Wash and wipe some large ripe potatoes, and bake in a
quick oven until tender, say from three-quarters of an
hour to an hour, if of a good size. Serve in a napkin
with the skins on. Tear or cut a hole in the top when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
you eat them, put in a bit of butter with salt and pepper.
They are good for boys’ cold fingers at supper-time on
winter nights.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Take two cupfuls of cold mashed potato, and stir into
it two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, beating to a white
cream before adding anything else. Then put with this
two eggs whipped very light and a teacupful of cream or
milk, salting to taste. Beat all well, pour into a deep
dish, and bake in a quick oven until it is nicely browned.
If properly mixed, it will come out of the oven light, puffy,
and delectable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potatoes Warmed Over</span>—<i>alias au Maître d’Hôtel</i>.</h4>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes a quarter of an inch thick,
and put into a saucepan, with four or five tablespoonfuls of
milk, two or three of butter, pepper, salt, and some chopped
parsley. Heat quickly, stirring all the time until ready
to boil, when stir in the juice of half a lemon. This last
ingredient entitles the dish to the foreign title. Pour into
a deep dish, and serve very hot.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Season cold mashed potato with pepper, salt, and nutmeg.
Beat to a cream, with a tablespoonful of melted
butter to every cupful of potato. Bind with two or three
beaten eggs, and add some minced parsley. Roll into
oval balls, dip in beaten egg, then in bread-crumbs, and
fry in hot lard or drippings.</p>

<p>Pile in a pyramid upon a flat dish, and serve.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Pare, wash, and slice some raw potatoes as thin as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
wafers. This can be done with a sharp knife, although there
is a little instrument for the purpose, to be had at the
house-furnishing stores, which flutes prettily as well as
slices evenly. Lay in ice-water for half an hour, wipe
dry in two cloths, spreading them upon one, and pressing
the other upon them. Have ready in the frying-pan some
boiling lard or nice dripping, fry the potatoes to a light
brown, sprinkle with salt, and serve in a napkin laid in a
deep dish and folded over them. To dry them of the fat,
take from the frying-pan as soon as they are brown, with
a perforated skimmer, put into a cullender and shake for
an instant. They should be crisp and free from grease.</p>


<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p class='unindent'>Chop cold boiled potatoes into bits, season with pepper
and salt, and fry lightly in dripping or butter, turning
them constantly until nicely browned.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potato Ribbon.</span></h4>

<p>Pare and lay in ice-water for an hour. Choose the
largest and soundest potatoes you can get for this dish. At
the end of the hour, pare, with a small knife, round and
round in one continuous curling strip. There is also an
instrument for this purpose, which costs but a trifle, and
will do the work deftly and expeditiously. Handle with
care, fry—a few at a time, for fear of entanglement—in
lard or clarified drippings, drain, and arrange neatly upon
a hot flat dish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Crème.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Put into a saucepan three tablespoonfuls of butter, a
small handful of parsley chopped small, salt and pepper
to taste. Stir up well until hot, add a small teacupful of
cream or rich milk, thicken with two teaspoonfuls of flour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and stir until it boils. Chop some cold boiled potatoes,
put into the mixture, and boil up once before serving.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stuffed Potatoes.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Take large, fair potatoes, bake until soft, and cut a
round piece off the top of each. Scrape out the inside
carefully, so as not to break the skin, and set aside the
empty cases with the covers. Mash the inside very
smoothly, working into it while hot some butter and
cream—about half a teaspoonful of each for every potato.
Season with salt and pepper, with a good pinch of grated
cheese for each; work it very soft with milk, and put into
a saucepan to heat, stirring, to prevent burning. When
scalding hot, stir in one well-beaten egg for six large
potatoes. Boil up once, fill the skins with the mixture,
replacing the caps, return them to the oven for three
minutes; arrange upon a napkin in a deep dish, the caps
uppermost; cover with a fold of the napkin, and eat hot.</p>


<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p class='unindent'>You may omit the eggs and put in a double quantity of
cheese. They are very good.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potato Scallops.</span></h4>

<p>Boil, and mash the potatoes soft with a little milk.
Beat up light with melted butter—a dessertspoonful for
every half-pint of the potato—salt and pepper to taste.
Fill some patty-pans or buttered scallop shells with the
mixture, and brown in an oven, when you have stamped
a pattern on the top of each. Glaze, while hot, with
butter, and serve in the shells.</p>

<p>If you like, you can strew some grated cheese over the
top.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span>—(<i>Whole.</i>)</h4>

<p>Boil and peel some large, ripe potatoes, and three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of an hour before a piece of roast beef is
removed from the fire, skim the fat from the gravy; put
the potatoes in the dripping-pan, having dredged them
well with flour. Baste them, to prevent scorching, with
the gravy, and when quite brown, drain on a sieve. Lay
them about the meat in the dish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Browned Potato.</span>—(<i>Mashed.</i>)</h4>

<p>This is also an accompaniment to roast beef or mutton.
Mash some boiled potatoes smoothly with a little milk,
pepper, salt, and a boiled onion (minced); make into
small cones or balls; flour well, and put under or beside
the meat, half an hour or so before you take it up. Skim
off all the fat from the gravy before putting them in.
Drain them dry when brown, and lay around the meat
when dished.</p>

<p>These are nice with roast spare-rib, or any roast pork
that is not <i>too</i> fat.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Broiled Potatoes.</span></h4>

<p>Cut whole boiled potatoes lengthwise, into slices a
quarter of an inch thick, and lay upon a gridiron over a
hot, bright fire. Brown on both sides, sprinkle with pepper
and salt, lay a bit of butter upon each, and eat very
hot.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h4>

<p>Make cold mashed potato into flat cakes; flour and
fry in lard, or good sweet dripping, until they are a light-brown.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Roast Sweet Potatoes.</span></h4>

<p>Select those of uniform size, wash, wipe, and roast until
you can tell, by gently pressing the largest between the
finger and thumb, that it is mellow throughout. Serve in
their jackets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Sweet, as well as Irish potatoes, are very good for pic-nic
luncheon, roasted in hot ashes. This, it will be remembered,
was the dinner General Marion set before the British
officer as “quite a feast, I assure you, sir. We don’t
often fare so well as to have sweet potatoes and salt.”</p>

<p>The feast was cleansed from ashes by the negro orderly’s
shirt-sleeve, and served upon a natural trencher of pine-bark.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Boiled Sweet Potatoes.</span></h4>

<p>Have them all as nearly the same size as possible; put
into cold water, without any salt, and boil until a fork
will easily pierce the largest. Turn off the water, and
lay them in the oven to dry for five minutes. Peel before
sending to table.</p>


<h4><i>Or,</i> ✠</h4>

<p class='unindent'>Parboil, and then roast until done. This is a wise plan
when they are old and watery. Boiling is apt to render
them tasteless. Another way still is to boil until they are
almost done, when peel and bake brown, basting them
with butter several times, but draining them dry before
they go to the table.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fried Sweet Potatoes</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Parboil them, skin, and cut lengthwise into slices a
quarter of an inch thick. Fry in sweet dripping or
butter.</p>

<p>Cold boiled potatoes may be cooked in this way. Or
you can chop them up with an equal quantity of cold Irish
potatoes, put them into a frying-pan with a good lump of
butter, and stir until they are hot and slightly brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>


<h3>CABBAGE.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Boiled Cabbage.</span></h4>

<p>Pick off the outer green leaves, quarter, examine carefully
to be sure there are no insects in it, and lay for an
hour in cold water. Then put into a pot with plenty of
boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes. Throw away the
water, and fill up the pot from the boiling tea-kettle.
Cook until tender all through. Three-quarters of an hour
will do for a good-sized cabbage when young. Late in the
season you must be guided by the tenderness of the stalk.
Drain well, chop, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter,
pepper, and salt. Serve very hot. If you boil corned
beef or pork to eat with cabbage, let the second water be
taken from the pot in which this is cooking. It will flavor
it nicely.</p>

<p><i>Always</i> boil cabbage in two waters.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Bacon and Cabbage.</span></h4>

<p>This, I need hardly say, is a favorite country dish at
the South. The old-fashioned way of preparing it was to
boil meat and cabbage together, and serve, reeking with
fat, the cabbage in quarters, soaking yet more of the essence
from the ham or middling about which it lay. In
this shape it justly earned a reputation for grossness and
indigestibility that banished it, in time, from many tables.</p>

<p>Yet it is a savory and not unwholesome article of food in
winter, if the cabbage be boiled in two waters, the second
being the “pot liquor” from the boiling meat. Drain
thoroughly in a cullender, pressing out every drop of
water that will flow, without breaking the tender leaves;
and when the meat is dished, lay the cabbage neatly
about it, and upon each quarter a slice of hard-boiled egg.</p>

<p>When you eat, season with pepper, salt, and vinegar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stuffed Cabbage.</span></h4>

<p>Choose for this purpose a large, firm cabbage. Take
off the outer leaves, and lay in boiling water ten minutes,
then in very cold. Do this several hours before you are
ready to stuff it. When perfectly cold, bind a broad tape
about it, or a strip of muslin, that it may not fall apart
when the stalk is taken out. Remove this with a thin sharp
knife, leaving a hole about as deep as your middle-finger.
Without widening the mouth of the aperture, excavate
the centre until you have room for four or five tablespoonfuls
of the force-meat—more, if the head be large. Chop
the bits you take out very small; mix with some cold
boiled pork or ham, or cooked sausage-meat, a <i>very</i> little
onion, pepper, salt, a pinch of thyme, and some bread-crumbs.
Fill the cavity with this, bind a wide strip of
muslin over the hole in the top, and lay the cabbage in a
large saucepan with a pint of “pot-liquor” from boiled beef
or ham. Stew gently until very tender. Take out the
cabbage, unbind carefully, and lay in a dish. Keep hot
while you add to the gravy, when you have strained it,
pepper, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and two or three
tablespoonfuls rich milk or cream. Boil up, and pour
over the cabbage.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">“Collards,” or Cabbage-Sprouts.</span></h4>

<p>Pick over carefully, lay in cold water, slightly salted,
half an hour; shake in a cullender to drain, and put into
boiling water, keeping at a fast boil until tender. A piece
of pork seasons them pleasantly. In this case put the
meat on first, adding the greens when it is parboiled, and
cooking them together. Boil in an uncovered vessel.
Drain very well; chop and heap in a dish, laying the
meat on top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage.</span> ✠</h4>

<p>Boil a firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, changing the
water then for more from the boiling tea-kettle. When
tender, drain and set aside until perfectly cold. Chop fine,
and add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pepper,
salt, three tablespoonfuls rich milk or cream. Stir all well
together, and bake in a buttered pudding-dish until
brown. Eat very hot.</p>

<p>I can conscientiously recommend this dish even to those
who are not fond of any of the ordinary preparations of
cabbage. It is digestible and palatable, more nearly
resembling cauliflower in taste than its coarser and commoner
cousin—<i>German</i>.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fried Cabbage.</span></h4>

<p>Chop cold boiled cabbage, and drain very dry, stirring
in a little melted butter, pepper, and salt, with three or
four tablespoonfuls of cream. Heat all in a buttered
frying-pan, stirring until smoking hot; then let the mixture
stand just long enough to brown slightly on the
under-side. It is improved by the addition of a couple of
beaten eggs. Turn out by putting a flat dish above the
pan, upside-down, and reversing the latter. This is a
breakfast dish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sauerkraut.</span></h4>

<p>Shred or chop the cabbage fine. Line a barrel, keg, or
jar with cabbage-leaves on the bottom and sides. Put in
a layer of the cut cabbage, three inches in depth; press
down well and sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of salt.
When you have packed five layers in this way, press hard
with a board cut to fit loosely on the inside of the barrel
or jar. Put heavy weights on this, or pound with a
wooden beetle until the cabbage is a compact mass, when
remove the board and put in more layers of salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
shred cabbage, repeating the pounding every four or five
layers, until the vessel is full. Cover with leaves, and
put the board on the top of these with a heavy weight to
keep it down. Set all away to ferment. In three weeks
remove the scum, and if need be, cover with water. Keep
in a cool, dry cellar. It can be eaten raw or boiled, and
seasoned with pork.</p>

<p>This is the mode <i>simple</i> if not <i>pure</i> of preparing this, to
nostrils unaccustomed to it, malodorous compound. Some
add to the salt whole black peppers, cloves, garlic, and
mace,—“then put it away,” as a mild, motherly Teuton
dame once told me, “in the cellar to r—”—“Rot!” interpolated
a disgusted bystander, anticipating her deliberate
utterance. “No, my dear,” drawled the placid Frau,
“to <i>ripen</i>.”</p>



<h3>CAULIFLOWER.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Boiled Cauliflower.</span></h4>

<p>Pick off the leaves and cut the stalk close to the bottom
of the bunch of flowers. Lay in cold water for half an
hour. Unless <i>very</i> large, do not cut it; if you do, quarter
neatly. Tie a close net of coarse bobbinet lace or tarlatan
about it to prevent breaking or bruising; put into boiling
water salted, and cook until tender. Undo and remove
the net, and lay the cauliflower in a hot dish. Have ready
a large cupful of nice drawn butter and pour over it. A
little lemon-juice makes of this a <i>sauce tartare</i>.</p>

<p>Cut with a silver knife and fork in helping it out, and
give a little of the sauce to each person. Take it out of
the water as soon as it is done, serve quickly, and eat hot.
It darkens with standing.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stewed Cauliflower.</span></h4>

<p>Use for this dish the smaller and more indifferent cauliflowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Cut them into small clusters; lay in cold salt
and water half an hour, and stew fifteen minutes in boiling
water. Turn most of this off, leaving but half a
teacupful in the saucepan. Add to this a half-cupful of
milk thickened with a very little rice or wheat flour,
and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, pepper, and salt.
Shake the saucepan over the fire gently until it boils;
take out the cauliflowers with a perforated skimmer, lay
in order upon a dish, and pour the sauce over them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scalloped Cauliflower.</span></h4>

<p>Boil until tender, clip into neat clusters, and pack—the
stems downward—in a buttered pudding-dish. Beat up a
cupful of bread-crumbs to a soft paste with two tablespoonfuls
of melted butter and six of cream or milk;
season with pepper and salt, bind with a beaten egg, and
with this cover the cauliflower. Cover the dish closely
and bake six minutes in a quick oven; brown in five
more, and serve very hot in the dish in which they were
baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broccoli and Brussels Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over, wash carefully, cut off the lower part of the
stems and lay in cold water, slightly salted, half an hour.
Cook quickly in boiling water, with a little salt, until
tender. This will be in twelve or fifteen minutes. Cook
in an uncovered saucepan. Drain well, lay in a neat
pile lightly heaped in the centre of a dish, and pour
drawn butter over them, or serve this in a tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broccoli and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil two or three heads of broccoli until tender. Have
ready two cupfuls of butter drawn in the usual way, and
beat into it, while hot, four well-whipped eggs. Lay buttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
toast in the bottom of a hot dish, and on this the
largest head of broccoli whole, as a centre-piece. Arrange
close about this the others cut into clusters, the stems
downward, and pour the egg-sauce over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and lay in cold water, slightly salted, until the
water boils in the saucepan intended for them. Put
them in and boil until very tender. The time will depend
upon their age. Drain and mash in the cullender
with a wooden spoon, stirring in at the last a tablespoonful
of butter with pepper and salt to taste, and serve hot.</p>

<p>If eaten with boiled corned beef, you may take a little
of the liquor from the pot in which the meat is cooking;
put it into a saucepan, boil up once to throw off the scum,
skim clean, and cook the turnips in this.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If the turnips are young, rub them when tender <i>through</i>
the cullender; add a little milk, butter, pepper, and salt;
heat to boiling in a clean saucepan and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Turnips Boiled Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Pare smoothly, and trim all into the same size and
shape. Lay in cold water half an hour. Put on in boiling
water, with a tablespoonful of butter, and stew until
tender. Drain dry, without crushing or breaking them;
pile in a deep dish, and cover with a white sauce made of
butter drawn in milk. Turnips should be eaten very hot
always.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>In respect to quantity, spinach is desperately deceitful.
I never see it drained after it is boiled without bethinking
myself of a picture I saw many years since, illustrative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the perils of innocent simplicity. A small (lucky) boy
and big (unlucky) one have been spending their holiday
in fishing. While the former, well satisfied with the result
of his day’s sport, is busy putting up his rod and
tackle, the designing elder dexterously substitutes his own
string of minnows for the other’s store of fine perch. The
little fellow, turning to pick it up, without a suspicion of
the cruel cheat, makes piteous round eyes at his fellow,
ejaculating, “How they have <i>swhrunk</i>!”</p>

<p>A young housekeeper of my acquaintance, ordering a
spring dinner for herself and husband, purchased a quart
of spinach. When it should have appeared upon the
table, there came in its stead a platter of sliced egg, she
having given out one for the dressing. “Where is the
spinach?” she demanded of the maid of all work. “Under
the egg, ma’am!” And it was really all there.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>—Get enough spinach to be visible to the naked
eye. A peck is not too much for a family of four or five.</p>

<p>Pick it over very carefully; it is apt to be gritty.
Wash in several waters, and let it lie in the last half an
hour at least. Take out with your hands, shaking each
bunch well, and put into boiling water, with a little salt.
Boil from fifteen to twenty minutes. When tender, drain
thoroughly, chop <i>very</i> fine; put into a saucepan with a
piece of butter the size of an egg, and pepper to taste.
Stir until very hot, turn into a dish and shape into a flat-topped
mound with a silver or wooden spoon; slice some
hard-boiled eggs and lay on top.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Rub the yolks of the eggs to a powder; mix with butter,
and when your mound is raised, spread smoothly over the
flat top. Four eggs will dress a good-sized dish. Cut the
whites into rings and garnish, laying them on the yellow
surface. This makes a pleasant dressing for the spinach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Crème.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and chop <i>very</i> fine, or rub through a cullender.
Season with pepper and salt. Beat in, while warm, three
tablespoonfuls melted butter (this is for a large dish). Put
into a saucepan and heat, stirring constantly. When
smoking hot, add three tablespoonfuls of cream and a
teaspoonful white sugar. Boil up once, still stirring, and
press firmly into a hot bowl or other mould. Turn into
a hot dish and garnish with boiled eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Shell and lay in cold water until you are ready to cook
them. Put into salted boiling water, and cook from
twenty minutes to half an hour. If young and fresh, the
shorter time will suffice. If just gathered from your own
vines and tender, season only with salt. Market peas are
greatly improved by the addition of a small lump of
white sugar. It improves taste and color. The English
always put it in, also a sprig of mint, to be removed when
the peas are dished. Drain well, and dish, with a great
lump of butter stirred in, and a little pepper. Keep
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pea Fritters or Cakes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cook a pint or three cups more peas than you need for
dinner. Mash while hot with a wooden spoon, seasoning
with pepper, salt, and butter. Put by until morning.
Make a batter of two whipped eggs, a cupful of milk,
quarter teaspoonful soda, a half teaspoonful cream tartar,
and half a cup of flour. Stir the pea-mixture into this,
beating very hard, and cook as you would ordinary griddle-cakes.</p>

<p>I can testify, from experience, that they make a delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
morning dish, and hereby return thanks to the
unknown friend to whom I am indebted for the receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus</span> (<i>boiled.</i>)</h3>

<p>Cut your stalks of equal length, rejecting the woody or
lower portions, and scraping the white part which remains.
Throw into cold water as you scrape them. Tie
in a bunch with soft strings—muslin or tape—and put
into boiling water slightly salted. If very young and
fresh, it is well to tie in a piece of coarse net to protect
the tops. Boil from twenty to forty minutes, according
to the age. Just before it is done, toast two or three
slices of bread, cutting off the crust; dip in the asparagus
liquor, butter, and lay in a hot dish. When you take up
the asparagus, drain, unbind the bundle, and heap it
upon the toast, with bits of butter between the stalks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut twenty-five or thirty heads of asparagus into bits
half an inch long, and boil fifteen minutes. Have a cupful
of rich drawn butter in a saucepan, and put in the
asparagus when you have drained it dry. Heat together
to a boil, seasoning with pepper and salt, and pour into a
buttered bake dish. Break five or six eggs carefully over
the surface; put a bit of butter upon each; sprinkle with
salt, and pepper, and put in the oven until the eggs are set.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may beat the eggs—yolks and whites separately—to
a froth; season with butter, pepper, and salt; stir them
together, with the addition of three tablespoonfuls of milk
or cream, and pour evenly over the asparagus mixture in
the dish. This is decidedly the better way of the two,
although somewhat more troublesome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus in Ambush.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut off the tender tops of fifty heads of asparagus; boil
and drain them. Have ready half a dozen (or more) stale
biscuit or rolls, from which you have cut a neat top slice
and scraped out the crumb. Set them in the oven to
crisp, laying the tops beside them that the cavities may be
well dried. Meanwhile, put into a saucepan a sugarless
custard made of a pint—if you need so much—of milk,
and four well-whipped eggs. Boil the milk first, before
beating in the eggs; set over the fire and stir until it
thickens, when add a great spoonful of butter, a little salt
and pepper; lastly, the asparagus tops, minced fine. Do
not let it boil, but take from the fire so soon as the asparagus
is fairly in; fill the rolls with the mixture, put on the
tops, fitting them accurately; set in the oven three
minutes, and arrange on a dish, to be eaten hot.</p>

<p>The number of rolls will depend upon their size. It is
better to have them small, so that one can be served to
each person. They will be found extremely nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off tops and tails, and skin them. Lay in cold
water half an hour, then put into a saucepan with enough
boiling water to cover them. Cook fifteen minutes and
drain off the water, re-covering them with more from the
boiling tea-kettle. Boil until a straw will pierce them;
drain and put into a dish with pepper, salt, and plenty of
butter. Send around drawn butter with them. Never
cook onions in an iron pot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Onions.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Young onions should always be cooked in this way.
Top, tail, and skin them, lay them in cold water half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hour or more, then put into a saucepan with hot water
enough to cover them. When half done, throw off all the
water, except a small teacupful—less, if your mess be
small; add a like quantity of milk, a great spoonful of
butter, with pepper and salt to taste. Stew gently until
tender, and turn into a deep dish.</p>

<p>If the onions are strong and large, boil in three waters,
throwing away all of the first and second, and reserving a
very little of the third to mix with the milk.</p>

<p>It ought to be more generally known that the disagreeable
odor left by any of the onion family upon the breath
may be removed by chewing and swallowing a few grains
of roasted coffee. No more nutritious vegetable ever
finds its way to our tables, and it is greatly to be regretted
that the unpleasant result just named should deter so
many from eating it. It is especially beneficial to brain-workers
and nervous invalids—the very people who are
least likely to taste it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Onions.</span></h3>

<p>The large Spanish or Bermuda onions are the only
kinds which are usually baked. Wash clean, but do not
remove the skins. Boil an hour—the water should be
boiling when they are put in, and slightly salt. Change
it twice during this time, always replenishing with more,
boiling-hot. Turn off the water, take the onions out and
lay upon a cloth, that all the moisture may be absorbed
or evaporate. Roll each in a round piece of buttered
tissue-paper, twisting it at the top to keep it closed, and
bake in a slow oven nearly an hour. When tender all
through, peel them, put them into a deep dish, and brown
slightly, basting with butter freely. This will take perhaps
a quarter of an hour more. Serve in a vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
dish, and pour the melted butter over them when you
have sprinkled with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and skin very large Bermuda onions. Lay in
cold water an hour. Parboil in boiling water half an
hour. Drain, and while hot extract the hearts, taking
care not to break the outer layers. Chop the inside thus
obtained very fine, with a little cold fat pork or bacon.
Add bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, mace, and wet with a
spoonful or two of cream. Bind with a well-beaten egg,
and work into a smooth paste. Stuff the onions with
this; put into a dripping-pan with a very little hot
water, and simmer in the oven for an hour, basting often
with melted butter. When done, take the onions up
carefully, and arrange the open ends uppermost in a
vegetable dish. Add to the gravy in the dripping-pan
the juice of half a lemon, four tablespoonfuls of cream or
milk, and a little browned flour wet with cold milk.
Boil up once, and pour over the onions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Loosen the skins by pouring scalding water upon them;
peel and cut them up, extracting the cores or hard parts
of the stem end, and removing all unripe portions. Stew
in a saucepan (tin or porcelain) half an hour, when add
salt and pepper to taste, a teaspoonful of white sugar, and
a tablespoonful of butter. Stew gently fifteen minutes
longer, and serve.</p>

<p>Some cooks thicken the tomatoes with a little grated
bread. A minced onion—a small one—improves the
flavor. Another pleasant variety is to put a quarter as
much green corn as you have tomatoes into the saucepan
when it is first set on the fire, and stew gently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Baked Tomatoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Choose large, smooth tomatoes, and cut a thin slice from
the blossom end of each, laying it aside for further use.
Scoop out the inside, and chop fine with a little grated
bread, some green corn, salt, pepper, a teaspoonful white
sugar, and a tablespoonful butter. Mix well, and stuff the
hollowed tomatoes. Fit the tops on neatly, place in circular
rows in a deep dish and bake three-quarters of an hour, to
a light brown. Fill the interstices with the force-meat if
you have any left, before you bake. Do not peel them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Peel and cut in slices a quarter of an inch thick. Pack
in a pudding-dish in alternate layers, with a force-meat
made of bread-crumbs, butter, salt, pepper, and a little
white sugar. Spread thickly upon each stratum of tomatoes,
and when the dish is nearly full, put tomatoes
uppermost, a good bit of butter upon each slice. Dust
with pepper and a little sugar. Strew with dry bread-crumbs,
and bake covered half an hour; remove the lid
and bake brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scallop of Tomatoes and Green Corn.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>This is made as above, substituting for the bread-crumbs
in the force-meat, green corn cut from the cob, and seasoning
with some fat pork chopped very fine, a minced
shallot, pepper, salt, and sugar. Let the top layer be tomatoes,
butter and season, and sift grated bread-crumbs
over it to brown the scallop. Bake covered half an hour;
uncover and leave in the oven as much longer. This
time is for a large dishful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select large, firm ones, and do not peel. Slice half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
inch thick, and broil upon an oyster gridiron. A few
minutes will suffice to cook them. Have ready in a cup
some hot butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, a little sugar,
and a half a teaspoonful of made mustard. As soon as
the tomatoes are done, dip each piece in this mixture and
lay upon a hot chafing-dish. When all are dished, heat
what remains of the seasoning to a boil, pour upon them,
and serve at once.</p>

<p>Broiled tomatoes are much liked by those who have
eaten them cooked in this manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes</span> (<i>Plain.</i>)</h3>

<p>Peel and slice a quarter of an inch thick. Pack in a
pudding-dish, seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, butter,
and a very little white sugar. Bake covered half an
hour, remove the lid, and brown for fifteen minutes. Five
minutes before taking from the oven, pour over the top
three or four tablespoonfuls of cream whipped up for a
few minutes with melted butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Do not loosen the skins with scalding water. It impairs
the flavor and destroys the crispness. Pare with a
keen knife, slice and lay in a glass dish. Season with
pepper, salt, and vinegar, stirring a piece of ice rapidly
around in the dressing before pouring it over the tomatoes,
and setting the dish in the refrigerator until wanted.</p>

<p>There is no salad, excepting, perhaps, lettuce and
cucumbers, that is more improved by the use of ice than
tomatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare neatly from end to end, and lay in ice-water one
hour. Wipe them and slice thin. Season with pepper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
salt and vinegar—and oil, if you wish—laying some bits
of ice among them, with thin slices of onion. Cucumbers
should be gathered while the dew is on them, and eaten
the same day. Leave them in a cool place until you are
ready to pare them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Cucumbers.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare and lay in ice-water half an hour. Cut lengthwise,
into slices <i>nearly</i> half an inch thick, and lay in
ice-water ten minutes longer. Wipe each piece dry with
a soft cloth, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and dredge
with flour. Fry to a delicate brown in sweet clarified
dripping, nice lard, or butter.</p>

<p>Many declare that cucumbers are never fit to eat unless
fried, and they are assuredly far more wholesome than
when served raw.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, lay in ice-water an hour; then, slice a quarter of
an inch thick. Pick out the seeds with a penknife, and
put into a saucepan with enough boiling water to cover
them. Stew fifteen minutes, and drain off the water.
Add enough from the boiling tea-kettle to keep them
from burning; season with salt and pepper, and stir
carefully in a tablespoonful of butter—or two, should the
quantity of cucumber be large. Stew gently ten minutes,
and add half a cupful of rich milk; thicken with a little
flour, boil up, and serve in a deep dish, squeezing some
lemon-juice in at the last.</p>

<p>This is a popular English dish, although it seems a
strange one to American ideas.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Green Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Choose young sugar-corn, full grown, but not hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
test with the nail. When the grain is pierced, the milk
should escape in a jet, and not be thick. Clean by stripping
off the outer leaves, turn back the innermost covering
carefully, pick off every thread of silk, and recover
the ear with the thin husk that grew nearest it. Tie at
the top with a bit of thread, put into boiling water salted,
and cook fast from twenty minutes to half an hour, in
proportion to size and age. Cut off the stalks close to the
cob, and send whole to table wrapped in a napkin.</p>

<p>Or, you can cut from the cob while hot, and season
with butter, pepper and salt. Send to table in a vegetable
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn and Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of green corn cut from the cob,
and tomatoes sliced and peeled. Stew together half an
hour; season with pepper, salt, and a <i>very</i> little sugar.
Stew fifteen minutes longer, and stir in a great lump of
butter. Five minutes later, pour out and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>This is made of green corn and Lima beans, although
you can substitute for the latter string or butter beans.
Have a third more corn than beans, when the former has
been cut from the cob and the beans shelled. Put into
boiling water enough to cover them—no more—and stew
gently together until tender—perhaps half an hour—stirring
now and then. Pour off nearly all the water, and
add a large cupful of milk. Stew in this, watching to
prevent burning, for an hour; then stir in a great lump
of butter, a teaspoonful of flour wet with cold milk, pepper
and salt to taste. Boil up once, and pour into a deep
vegetable-dish. If you use string-beans, string and cut
up into half-inch lengths before cooking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>1 dozen ears of corn—large ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grate the corn from the cob; beat the whites and yolks
of the eggs separately. Put the corn and yolks together,
stir <i>hard</i>, and add the butter; then the milk gradually,
beating all the while; next the sugar and a little salt;
lastly the whites. Bake slowly at first, covering the dish,
for an hour. Remove the cover, and brown finely.</p>

<p>This is a most delicious accompaniment to a meat
course, when properly mixed and baked. Warm up what
is left from dinner for breakfast, by moistening it with
a little warm milk, and stirring in a saucepan until
smoking hot. You can make this pudding from canned
corn in winter, chopping the corn fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Fritters or Cakes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Grate the corn, and allow an egg and a half for every
cupful, with a tablespoonful of milk or cream. Beat the
eggs well, add the corn by degrees, beating very hard;
salt to taste; put a tablespoonful of melted butter to every
pint of corn; stir in the milk, and thicken with just
enough flour to hold them together—say a tablespoonful
for every two eggs. You may fry in hot lard, as you
would fritters, but a better plan is to cook upon a griddle,
like batter cakes. Test a little first, to see that it is of
the right consistency.</p>

<p>Eaten at dinner or breakfast, these always meet with a
cordial welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Green Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Cut from the cob, and stew fifteen minutes in boiling
water. Turn off most of this, cover with cold milk, and
stew until very tender, adding, before you take it up, a
large lump of butter cut into bits and rolled in flour.
Season with pepper and salt to taste. Boil five minutes,
and serve.</p>

<p>Cold corn left from dinner should be cut from the cob
and stewed a few minutes in a little milk, adding seasoning
as above. Or, you can mix it with chopped cold potatoes—Irish
or sweet; heat a piece of butter or beef-dripping
in a frying-pan, and stir in the mixture until
smoking-hot. Never throw away a good ear of sweet corn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roasted Green Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Turn back the husks upon the stalk, pick off the silk,
recover with the husks as closely as possible, and roast in
the hot ashes of a wood-fire. Eat with butter, salt, and
pepper, out of doors, in the forest, or on the beach.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify or Oyster-Plant.</span> (<i>Stewed.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Scrape the roots, dropping each into cold water as soon
as it is cleaned. Exposure to the air blackens them.
Cut in pieces an inch long, put into a saucepan with hot
water enough to cover them, and stew until tender. Turn off
nearly all the water, and add a cupful of cold milk.
Stew ten minutes after this begins to boil; put in a great
lump of butter, cut into bits, and rolled in flour; pepper
and salt to taste. Boil up once, and serve. The taste is
curiously like that of stewed oysters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Salsify, or Mock Oysters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Scrape the roots thoroughly, and lay in cold water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
ten or fifteen minutes. Boil whole until tender, drain,
and when cold, mash with a wooden spoon to a smooth
paste, picking out all the fibres. Moisten with a little
milk; add a tablespoonful of butter, and an egg and a
half for every cupful of salsify. Beat the eggs light.
Make into round cakes, dredge with flour, and fry brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-Plant.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Slice the egg-plant at least half an inch thick; pare
each piece carefully, and lay in salt and water, putting a
plate upon the topmost to keep it under the brine, and let
them alone for an hour or more. Wipe each slice, dip in
beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot lard
until well done and nicely browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Egg-Plant.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Parboil for ten minutes. Slit each down the side, and
extract the seeds. Prop open the cut with a bit of clean
wood or china, and lay in cold salt and water while you
prepare the force-meat. Make this of bread-crumbs,
minute bits of fat pork, salt, pepper, nutmeg, parsley, and
a <i>very</i> little onion, chopped up together. Moisten with
cream, and bind with a beaten egg. Fill the cavity in
the egg-plant with this; wind soft pack-thread about
them to keep the slit shut, and bake, putting a little
water in the dripping-pan. Baste with butter and water
when they begin to cook. Test with a straw when they
are tender, and baste twice at the last with butter. Lay the
egg-plants in a dish, add two or three tablespoonfuls of
cream to the gravy, thicken with a little flour, put in a
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, boil up once, and pour
over the vegetable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Carrots.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and scrape well, and lay in cold water half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hour. If large, split them, or cut across in two or three
pieces. Put into boiling water, slightly salted, and boil
until tender. Large ones will require nearly an hour
and a half to cook. Young carrots should only be
washed before they are boiled, and the skin be rubbed off
with a cloth afterward. Butter well, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Carrots.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and lay in cold water half an hour or more.
Boil whole three-quarters of an hour, drain, and cut into
round slices a quarter of an inch thick. Put on in a saucepan
with a teacupful of broth—veal, or beef, or mutton;
pepper and salt to taste, and stew gently half an hour.
Just before they are done, add four tablespoonfuls cream
or milk, and a good lump of butter cut into bits, and
rolled in flour. Boil up and serve.</p>

<p>If you have not the broth, use water, and put in a
tablespoonful of butter when the saucepan is set on the
fire, in addition to the quantity I have specified.</p>


<h3><i>Another Way.</i></h3>

<p>Scrape and boil until nearly done. Cut into small
squares, and put into a saucepan, with two small onions,
minced; a little chopped parsley, pepper and salt to
taste, and half a cup of rather thin drawn butter.
They will require half an hour’s simmering. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Carrots.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, and lay in cold water a while. Boil
very tender in hot water, slightly salted. Drain, and
mash with a beetle or wooden spoon, working in a large
spoonful of butter, with pepper and salt. A little cream
will improve them. Mound as you would mashed potatoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and stamp a figure upon them, or mark in squares
with a knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French, or String or “Snap” Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Break off the tops and bottoms and “string” carefully.
<i>Then</i> pare both edges with a sharp knife, to be certain that
no remnant of the tough fibre remains. Not one cook in
a hundred performs this duty as deftly and thoroughly as
it should be done. I have heard several gentlemen say
that they could always tell, after the first mouthful,
whether the mistress or the hireling had “strung” the
beans. It is a tedious and disagreeable business, this
pulling bits of woody thread out of one’s mouth when he
wants to enjoy his dinner.</p>

<p>Cut the beans thus cleared of their troublesome <i>attachés</i>,
in pieces an inch long, and lay in cold water with a little
salt for fifteen or twenty minutes. Drain them, and put
into a saucepan of boiling water. Boil quickly, twenty
minutes if well-grown—less if small—at any rate, until
tender. Drain in a cullender until the water ceases to drip
from them. Dish with a great spoonful of butter stirred in.</p>

<p>To my taste, beans <i>need</i> to have a bit of bacon boiled
with them—whole, or chopped into bits that dissolve in
the boiling. It mellows the rank taste you seek to remove
by boiling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima and Butter Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell into cold water; let them lie a while; put into a
pot with plenty of boiling water and a little salt, and cook
fast until tender. Large ones sometimes require nearly
an hour’s boiling. The average time is forty minutes.
Drain and butter well when dished, peppering to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney and other Small Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell into cold water, and cook in boiling until tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
A small piece of fat bacon boiled with them is an advantage
to nearly all. If you do this, do not salt them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dried Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and soak over night in lukewarm water, changing
it several times for warmer. If this is done they will
require but two hours’ boiling. Drain very thoroughly,
pressing them firmly, but lightly, in the cullender with a
wooden spoon; salt, pepper and mix in a great lump of
butter when they are dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, but do not touch with a knife before they are
boiled. If cut while raw, they bleed themselves pale in
the hot water. Boil until tender—if full-grown at least
two hours. When done, rub off the skins, slice round if
large, split if young, and butter well in the dish. Salt
and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>A nice way is to slice them upon a hot dish, mix a great
spoonful of melted butter with four or five of vinegar, pepper
and salt, heat to boiling, and pour over the beets.</p>

<p>Instead of consigning the cold ones “left over” to the
swill pail, pour cold vinegar upon them and use as pickles
with cold or roast meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Boil young, sweet beets, until nearly done; skin and
slice them. Put into a saucepan with a minced shallot and
parsley, two tablespoonfuls melted butter, a like quantity
of vinegar, some salt and pepper. Set on the fire and
simmer twenty minutes, shaking the saucepan now and
then. Serve with the gravy poured over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>If young, scrape before cooking. If old, pare carefully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and if large, split. Put into boiling water, salted, and
boil, if small and tender, from half to three-quarters of an
hour, if full-grown, more than an hour. When tender,
drain and slice lengthwise, buttering well when you dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Parsnips.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil until tender, scrape off the skin, and cut in thick
lengthwise slices. Dredge with flour and fry in hot dripping
or lard, turning when one side is browned. Drain
off every drop of fat; pepper, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsnip Fritters.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil tender, mash smooth and fine, picking out the
woody bits. For three large parsnips allow two eggs, one
cup rich milk, one tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful
salt, three tablespoonfuls flour. Beat the eggs light, stir
in the mashed parsnips, beating hard; then the butter and
salt, next the milk, lastly the salt. Fry as fritters, or as
griddle-cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and scrape them, mash smooth with the back of a
wooden-spoon, or a potato beetle, picking out the fibres;
mix in three or four spoonfuls of cream, a great spoonful
of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Heat to boiling in a
saucepan, and serve. Heap in a mound as you would
potato cooked in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttered Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender and scrape. Slice a quarter of an inch
thick lengthwise. Put into a saucepan with three tablespoonfuls
melted butter, pepper and salt, and a little
chopped parsley. Shake over the fire until the mixture
boils. Lay the parsnips in order upon a dish, pour the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sauce over them, and garnish with parsley. It is a pleasant
addition to this dish to stir a few spoonfuls of cream
into the sauce after the parsnips are taken out; boil
up, and pour upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Sea-kale.</span></h3>

<p>Tie up in bunches when you have picked it over carefully,
and lay in cold water for an hour. Put into salted
boiling water, and cook twenty or thirty minutes until
tender. Lay some slices of buttered toast in the bottom
of a dish, clip the threads binding the stems of the sea-kale,
and pile upon the toast, buttering it abundantly.
Or, you can send around with it a boat of drawn butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Sea-kale.</span></h3>

<p>Clip off the stems, wash well, tie in neat bunches, and
when it has lain in cold water an hour or so, put into a
saucepan of boiling water, slightly salted. Boil fifteen
minutes, drain well, clip the threads, and return to the
saucepan, with a little rich gravy if you have it. If not,
pour in three or four tablespoonfuls of butter drawn in
milk, pepper and salt, and simmer eight or ten minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Artichokes.</span></h3>

<p>Strip off the outer leaves, and cut the stalks close to
the bottom. Wash well and lay in cold water two hours.
Immerse in boiling water, the stalk-ends uppermost, with
an inverted plate upon them to keep them down. Boil an
hour and a half, or until very tender. Arrange in circles
upon a dish, the tops up, and pour drawn butter over
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Squash or Cymbling.</span></h3>

<p>There are many varieties of this vegetable, but the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
rules for cooking them are the same. Unless they
are extremely tender, it is best to pare them, cutting away
as little as possible besides the hard outer rind. Take out
the seeds, when you have quartered them, and lay the
pieces in cold water. Boil until tender throughout. Drain
well, pressing out all the water; mash soft and smooth,
seasoning with butter, pepper, and salt. Do this quickly,
that you may serve up hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winter Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, take out the seeds, cut into small pieces, and stew
until soft and tender. Drain, press well, to rid it of all
the water, and mash with butter, pepper, and salt. It will
take much longer to cook than the summer squash, and
before you put it into hot water, should lie in cold at least
two hours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pumpkin.</span></h3>

<p>Cut in two, extract the seeds, slice, and pare. Cover
with cold water for an hour; put over the fire in a pot of
boiling water and stew gently, stirring often, until it
breaks to pieces. Drain and squeeze, rub through a cullender,
then return to the saucepan with a tablespoonful
of butter, pepper, and salt to taste. Stir rapidly from the
bottom until very hot, when dish, rounding into a mound,
with “dabs” of pepper on the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Pumpkin.</span></h3>

<p>Choose the richest pumpkin you can find; take out the
seeds, cut in quarters or eighths, pare, and slice lengthwise
half an inch thick. Arrange in layers—not more than
two or three slices deep—in a shallow but broad baking-dish.
Put a <i>very</i> little water in the bottom, and bake
very slowly until not only done, but dry. It requires a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
long time, for the heat should be gentle. Butter each
strip on both sides when you dish, and eat hot with bread
and butter for tea.</p>

<p>I have been assured, by people who have tried it, that
this is a palatable dish to those who are fond of the flavor
of pumpkin. I insert it here upon their recommendation—not
my own.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poke Stalks.</span></h3>

<p>When the young stalks are not larger than a man’s
little finger, and show only a tuft of leaves at top a few
inches above ground, is the time to gather them. They
are unfit for table-use when larger and older. Scrape the
stalks, but do not cut off the leaves. Lay in cold water,
with a little salt, for two hours. Tie in bundles, as you
do asparagus, put into a saucepan of boiling water, and
cook fast three-quarters of an hour. Lay buttered toast
in the bottom of a dish, untie the bundles, and pile the
poke evenly upon it, buttering very well, and sprinkling
with pepper and salt. This is a tolerable substitute for
asparagus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p><i>Imprimis.</i>—Have nothing to do with them until you
are an excellent judge between the true and false. That
sounds somewhat like the advice of the careful mother to
her son, touching the wisdom of never going near the water
until he learned how to swim—but the caution can hardly
be stated too strongly. Not being ambitious of martyrdom,
even in the cause of gastronomical enterprise, especially
if the instrument is to be a contemptible, rank-smelling
fungus, I never eat or cook native mushrooms; but I
learned, years ago, in hill-side rambles, how to distinguish
the real from the spurious article. Shun low, damp, shady
spots in your quest. The good mushrooms are most plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in August and September, and spring up in the open,
sunny fields or commons, after low-lying fogs or soaking
dews. The top is a dirty white,—<i>par complaisance</i>, pearl-color,—the
under side pink or salmon, changing to russet
or brown soon after they are gathered. The poisonous
sport all colors, and are usually far prettier than their
virtuous kindred. Those which are dead-white above
and below, as well as the stalk, are also to be let alone.</p>

<p>Cook a peeled white onion in the pot with your mushrooms.
If it turn black, throw all away, and be properly
thankful for your escape. It is also deemed safe to reject
the mess of wild pottage, if in stirring them, your silver
spoon should blacken. But I certainly once knew a lady
who did not discover until hers were eaten and partially
digested, that the silver had come to grief in the discharge
of duty. It was very dark, and required a deal of rubbing
to restore cleanliness and polish; but the poison—if
death were, indeed, in the pot—was slow in its effects,
since she lived many years after the experiment. It is as
well perhaps, though, not to repeat it too often.</p>

<p>To re-capitulate.—The eatable ones are round when
they first show their heads in a critical world. As they
grow, the lower part unfolds a lining of salmon fringe,
while the stalk and top are dirty white. When the
mushroom is more than twenty-four hours old, or within
a few hours after it is gathered, the salmon changes to
brown. The skin can also be more easily peeled from
the edges than in the spurious kinds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Choose button mushrooms of uniform size. Wipe clean
and white with a wet flannel cloth, and cut off the stalks.
Put into a porcelain saucepan, cover with cold water, and
stew very gently fifteen minutes. Salt to taste; add a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
tablespoonful of butter, divided into bits and rolled in
flour. Boil three or four minutes; stir in three or four
tablespoonfuls of cream whipped up with an egg, stir
two minutes without letting it boil, and serve.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Rub them white, stew in water ten minutes; strain
partially, and cover with as much warm milk as you have
poured off water; stew five minutes in this; salt and pepper,
and add some veal or chicken gravy, or drawn butter.
Thicken with a little flour wet in cold milk, and a beaten
egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Take fresh ones,—the size is not very important,—cut
off nearly all the stalks, and wipe off the skin with wet
flannel. Arrange neatly in a pie-dish, pepper and salt,
sprinkle a little mace among them, and lay a bit of butter
upon each. Bake about half an hour, basting now and
then with butter and water, that they may not be too dry.
Serve in the dish in which they were baked, with <i>maître
d’hôtel</i> sauce poured over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Peel the finest and freshest you can get, score the under
side, and cut the stems close. Put into a deep dish and
anoint well, once and again, with melted butter. Salt and
pepper, and let them lie in the butter an hour and a half.
Then broil over a clear, hot fire, using an oyster-gridiron,
and turning it over as one side browns. Serve hot, well
buttered, pepper and salt, and squeeze a few drops of
lemon-juice upon each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and scrape the stalks when you have cut off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
roots. Cut off the green leaves and reject the greenest,
toughest stalks. Retain the blanched leaves that grow
nearest the heart. Keep in cold water until you send to
table. Serve in a celery glass, and let each guest dip in
salt for himself. (<i>See <a href="#Celery_Salad">Celery Salad</a>.</i>)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 bunch of celery—scraped, trimmed, and cut into inch lengths.</li>
<li>1 cup milk.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful of butter, rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the celery in clear water until tender. Turn off
the water, add the milk, and as soon as this boils, seasoning
and butter. Boil up once and serve very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Radishes.</span></h3>

<p>A friend of mine, after many and woful trials with “the
greatest plague of life,” engaged a supercilious young
lady who “only hired out in the best of families as a professed
cook.” She arrived in the afternoon, and was told
that tea would be a simple affair—bread-and-butter, cold
meat, cake, and a dish of radishes, which were brought in
from the garden as the order was given. The lady was
summoned to the parlor at that moment, and remarked in
leaving—“You can prepare those now, Bridget.” Awhile
later she peeped into the kitchen, attracted by the odor of
hot fat. The frying-pan hissed on the fire, the contents
were a half-pound of butter, and the “professional”
stood at the table with a radish topped and tailed in one
hand, a knife in the other. “I’m glad to see ye,” thus
she greeted the intruder. “Is it paled or <i>on</i>paled ye’ll
have them radishes? Some of the quality likes ’em fried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
wid the skins on—some widout. I thought I’d wait and
ask yerself.”</p>

<p>My readers can exercise their own choice in the matter
of peeling, putting the frying out of the question. Wash
and lay them in ice-water so soon as they are gathered.
Cut off the tops when your breakfast or supper is ready,
leaving about an inch of the stalks on; scrape off the skin
if you choose, but the red ones are prettier if you do not;
arrange in a tall glass or a round glass saucer, the stalks
outside, the points meeting in the centre; lay cracked ice
among them and send to table. Scrape and quarter the
large white ones.</p>

<p>Good radishes are crisp to the teeth, look cool, and taste
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Okra.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the young pods, in enough salted hot water to cover
them, until tender. Drain thoroughly, and when dished
pour over them a sauce of three or four spoonfuls melted
(not drawn) butter, a tablespoonful of vinegar, pepper, and
salt to taste. Heat to boiling before covering the okras
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Hominy.</span></h3>

<p>The large kind, made of cracked, not ground corn, is
erroneously termed “samp” by Northern grocers. This
is the Indian name for the fine-grained. To avoid confusion,
we will call the one large, the other small. Soak the
large over night in cold water. Next day put it into a
pot with at least two quarts of water to a quart of the
hominy, and boil slowly three hours, or until it is soft.
Drain in a cullender, heap in a root-dish, and stir in butter,
pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Soak the small hominy in the same way, and boil in as
much water, slowly, stirring very often, almost constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
at the last. It should be as thick as mush, and is generally
eaten at breakfast with sugar, cream, and nutmeg.
It is a good and exceedingly wholesome dish, especially
for children. The water in which it is boiled should be
slightly salt. If soaked in warm water, and the same be
changed once or twice for warmer, it will boil soft in an
hour. Boil in the last water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Hominy.</span></h3>

<p>If large, put a good lump of butter or dripping in the
frying-pan, and heat. Turn in some cold boiled hominy,
and cook until the under-side is browned. Place a dish
upside down on the frying-pan and upset the latter, that
the brown crust may be uppermost.</p>

<p>Eat with meat.</p>

<p>Cut the small hominy in slices and fry in hot lard or
drippings. Or, moisten to a soft paste with milk; beat in
some melted butter, bind with a beaten egg, form into
round cakes with your hands, dredge with flour and fry a
light brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>To a cupful of cold boiled hominy (small-grained) add a
tablespoonful melted butter and stir hard, moistening, by
degrees, with a little milk, beating to a soft light paste.
Put in a teaspoonful of white sugar, and lastly, a well-beaten
egg. Roll into oval balls with floured hands, dip
in beaten egg, then cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot lard.</p>

<p>Very good!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Hominy.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>To a cupful of cold boiled hominy (small kind) allow
two cups of milk, a heaping teaspoonful of butter, a teaspoonful
of white sugar, a little salt, and three eggs. Beat
the eggs very light, yolks and whites separately. Work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the yolks first into the hominy, alternately with the melted
butter. When thoroughly mixed, put in sugar and salt,
and go on beating while you soften the batter gradually
with the milk. Be careful to leave no lumps in the hominy.
Lastly stir in the whites, and bake in a buttered pudding-dish,
until light, firm, and delicately browned.</p>

<p>This can be eaten as a dessert, but it is a delightful vegetable,
and the best substitute that can be devised for
green corn pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Half a cup of rice.</li>
<li>1 pint milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>A little grated lemon-peel.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>A saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the rice three hours in warm water enough to
cover it. Drain <i>almost</i> dry, and pour in the milk. Stew
in a farina-kettle, or one saucepan set in another of hot
water, until the rice is very tender. Add the sugar, butter
and salt, and simmer ten minutes. Whisk the eggs to a
froth, and add cautiously, taking the saucepan from the
fire while you whip them into the mixture. Return to the
range or stove, and stir while they thicken, not allowing
them to boil. Remove the saucepan, and add the grated
lemon-peel; then turn out upon a well-greased dish to
cool. When cold and stiff, flour your hands and roll into
oval or pear-shaped balls; dip in beaten egg, then in fine
cracker-crumbs, and fry in nice lard.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can make a plainer dish of cold boiled rice, moistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with milk and a little melted butter to a smooth
paste. Add sugar and salt, bind with two or three beaten
eggs; make into cakes or balls, and proceed as directed
above. Eat hot with roast or boiled fowls. If you shape
like a pear, stick a clove in the small end for the stem.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over carefully and wash in two waters, letting it
stand in the last until you are ready to boil. Have ready
some boiling water slightly salted, and put in the rice.
Boil it just twenty minutes, and do not put a spoon in it,
but <i>shake</i> up hard and often, holding the cover on with
the other hand. When done, drain off the water, and set
the saucepan uncovered upon the range, where the rice
will dry, not burn, for five minutes.</p>

<p>Eat with boiled mutton or fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Macaroni.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Break half a pound of pipe macaroni in pieces an inch
long, and put into a saucepan of boiling water slightly
salted. Stew gently twenty minutes. It should be soft,
but not broken or split. Drain well and put a layer in
the bottom of a buttered pie or pudding-dish; upon this
grate some mild, rich cheese, and scatter over it some bits
of butter. Spread upon the cheese more macaroni, and
fill the dish in this order, having macaroni at the top,
buttered well, without the cheese. Add a few spoonfuls
of cream or milk, and a very little salt. Bake covered half
an hour, then brown nicely, and serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Macaroni—Italian Style.</span></h3>

<p>Break the macaroni into inch lengths, and stew twenty
minutes, or until tender. Prepare the sauce beforehand.
Cut half a pound of beef into strips and stew half an hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
The water should be cold when the meat is put in. At
the end of that time, add a minced onion and a pint of
tomatoes peeled and sliced. Boil for an hour, and strain
through a cullender when you have taken out the meat.
The sauce should be well boiled down by this time. You
do not want more than a pint for a large dish of macaroni.
Return the liquid to the saucepan, add a good
piece of butter, with pepper and salt, and stew until you
are ready to dish the macaroni. Drain this well, sprinkle
lightly with salt, and heap upon a chafing-dish or in a
root-dish. Pour the tomato-sauce over it; cover and let
it stand in a warm place ten minutes before sending to
table. Send around grated cheese with it. The Italians
serve the meat also in a separate dish as a ragoût, adding
some of the sauce, highly seasoned with pepper and other
spices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni à la Crème.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cook the macaroni ten minutes in boiling water.
Drain this off, and add a cupful of milk, with a little
salt. Stew until tender. In another saucepan heat a cup
of milk to boiling, thicken with a teaspoonful of flour,
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, and lastly, a beaten egg.
When this thickens, pour over the macaroni after it is
dished.</p>

<p>This is a simple and good dessert, eaten with butter,
sugar, and nutmeg, or sweet sauce. If set on with meat,
grate cheese thickly over it, or send around a saucer of
grated cheese with it.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Eggs.</span></h2>

<p>To guess (I do not say determine) whether an egg is
good, shut one eye; frame the egg in the hollow of the
hand, telescope-wise, and look at the sun through it with
the open eye. If you can distinctly trace the outline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the yolk and the white looks clear around it, the chances
are in favor of the egg and the buyer. Or, shake it
gently at your ear. If addled, it will gurgle like water;
if there is a chicken inside, you may distinguish a slight
“thud” against the sides of the egg. Or, still again, you
may try eggs from your own poultry-yard by putting
them into a pan of cold water. The freshest sink first.
Those that float are questionable—generally worse.</p>

<p>The best plan is to break them. In making cake, or
anything that requires more than one, break each over a
saucer, that it may be alone in its condemnation, if bad.
Reject doubtful ones without hesitation. Yield implicit
trust, or none at all.</p>

<p>Keep eggs in a cool, not cold place. Pack in bran or
salt, with the small end downward, if you wish to use
within two or three weeks; and furthermore, take the
precaution to grease them well with linseed oil, or wash
them over with a weak solution of gum tragacanth or
varnish. This excludes the air. Another way is to make
some pretty strong lime-water, allowing a pound of lime
to a gallon of boiling water. When perfectly cold, fill a
large jar with it in which you have packed the eggs,
small end downward; lay a light saucer upon the top to
keep them under water, and keep in a cool place. Renew
the lime-water every three weeks. You may add an
ounce of saltpetre to it.</p>

<p>Eggs for boiling may be “canned” as follows: So soon
as they are brought in from the nests, put two or three
dozen at a time in a deep pan; pour scalding water over
them; let it stand thirty seconds, and turn it all off. Cover
immediately with more scalding water, and repeat the
process yet the third time. Wipe dry, and pack in bran
or salt when they cool. This hardens the albumen into
an air-tight case for the yolk. Of course, you cannot use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
these eggs for cake or syllabubs, or anything that is
prepared with whipped eggs. Pack with the small end
down.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Put into a saucepan of <i>boiling</i> water with a tablespoon,
not to break or crack them. Only a slovenly cook, or a
careless one, drops them in with her fingers. Boil steadily
three minutes, if you want them soft—ten, if hard.</p>

<p>Another way is to put them on in cold water, and let it
come to a boil, which will be in ten minutes. The inside,
white and yolk, will be then of the consistency of custard.
Many gourmands like them best thus. Still another is to
put them in one of the silver egg-boilers used on the breakfast-table
(a covered bowl will do as well); cover them
with boiling water, and let them stand three minutes.
Pour this off, and refill with more, also boiling hot, and
leave them in it five minutes longer. Wrap in a napkin
in a deep dish, if you have not a regular egg-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dropped or Poached Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Strain some boiling water into a frying-pan, which must
also be perfectly clean. The least impurity will mar the
whiteness of the eggs. When the water boils, break the
eggs separately into a saucer. Take the frying-pan off,
and slip the eggs, one by one, carefully upon the surface.
When all are in, put back over the fire and boil gently
three minutes. Take out with a perforated skimmer, drain,
and lay upon slices of buttered toast in a hot dish. Garnish
with parsley, and dust with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poached Eggs à la Crème.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Nearly fill a clean frying-pan with strained water boiling
hot; strain a tablespoonful of vinegar through double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
muslin, and add to the water with a little salt. Slip your
eggs from the saucer upon the top of the water (first taking
the pan from the fire.) Boil three minutes and a half,
drain, and lay on buttered toast in a hot dish. Turn the
water from the pan and pour in half a cupful of cream or
milk. If you use the latter, thicken with a very little
corn-starch. Let it heat to a boil, stirring to prevent burning,
and add a great spoonful of butter, some pepper and
salt. Boil up once, and pour over the eggs. A better way
still is to heat the milk in a separate saucepan, that the
eggs may not have to stand. A little broth improves the
sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Fry the eggs in a little very nice salted lard; drain off
every drop of grease, and lay them upon a hot dish, with
neat slices of fried ham around the edges, half the size
of the slice as first carved from the ham. Trim off the
rough edges of the eggs, and cut the ham evenly in oblong
pieces before dishing. Garnish with parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Melt some butter in a frying-pan, and when it hisses
drop in the eggs carefully. Fry three minutes; dust
with pepper and salt, and transfer to a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Eggs.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil the eggs hard, cut in half crosswise, and take out
the yolks. Chop these fine, or rub to a paste, with a little
ground tongue or ham or cold fowl, some minced
parsley, some melted butter, and a <i>very</i> little made mustard.
Work well together and fill the whites with it,
setting them close together in a deep covered dish, the
open ends up. Have ready some veal gravy or chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
broth; heat to boiling in a saucepan with a half teaspoonful
chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and lastly three tablespoonfuls
of cream to a cup of broth. Boil up; pour
smoking hot over the eggs, let them stand five minutes,
closely covered, and send to table.</p>

<p>This is not an expensive dish. Eggs are always a
cheaper breakfast-dish for a small family than meat, even
at fifty cents a dozen. Six will make a nice quantity of
the fricassee, and it is a delicious relish. Always drop
hard-boiled eggs into cold water as soon as they are done,
to prevent the yolks from turning black.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Eggs.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil hard, and cut in round thick slices. Pepper and
salt; dip each in beaten raw egg, then in fine bread-crumbs
or powdered cracker, and fry in nice dripping or butter,
hissing hot. Drain off every drop of grease, and serve
on a hot dish for breakfast, with sauce, like that for fricasseed
eggs, poured over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Break six or seven eggs into a buttered dish, taking
care that each is whole, and does not encroach upon the
others so much as to mix or disturb the yolks. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt, and put a bit of butter upon each.
Put into an oven and bake until the whites are well set.
Serve very hot, with rounds of buttered toast, or sandwiches.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scrambled Eggs.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Put a good piece of butter in a frying-pan, and when it
is hot drop in the eggs, which should be broken whole
into a bowl. Stir in with them a little chopped parsley,
some pepper and salt, and keep stirring to and fro, up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and down, without cessation, for three minutes. Turn out
at once into a hot dish, or upon buttered toast and eat
without delay.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chinese Bird’s-Nest of Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Make a white sauce as follows: Stew half a pound of
lean veal, cut into strips, with a large sprig of parsley, in
a quart of water, until the meat is in rags, and the liquor
reduced one-half. Strain through tarlatan or lace, and
return to the saucepan with half a cupful of milk. When
it boils, thicken with a little rice or wheat flour, season
with white pepper and salt, and the juice of half a lemon.
Set in the corner to keep hot. Have ready six, or eight,
or ten hard-boiled eggs. Take out the yolks carefully,
and cut the whites into thin shreds. Pile the yolks in the
centre of a round, shallow dish, arrange the shreds of
white about them in the shape of a bird’s nest; give a
final stir to the sauce, and pour carefully over the eggs.
It should not rise higher in the dish than half way to the
top of the nest, when it flows down to its level. Garnish
with parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Eggs.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make a force-meat of chopped ham—ground is better—fine
bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, a little minced parsley, and
some melted butter. Moisten with milk to a soft paste,
and half fill some patty-pans or scallop-shells with the
mixture. Break an egg carefully upon the top of each,
dust with pepper and salt, and sift some very finely powdered
cracker over all. Set in the oven, and bake until
the eggs are <i>well</i> set—about eight minutes. Eat hot.
They are very nice. You can substitute ground tongue for
the ham.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poached Eggs, with Sauce.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make the sauce by putting half a cupful of hot water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in a saucepan, with a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, three
tablespoonfuls of veal or chicken broth (strained), pepper,
salt, mace, and a tablespoonful of butter, with a little
minced parsley. Boil slowly ten minutes, and stir in a
well-whipped egg carefully, lest it should curdle. Have
ready some poached eggs in a deep dish, and pour the
sauce over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs upon Toast.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Put a good lump of butter into the frying-pan. When
it is hot, stir in four or five well-beaten eggs, with pepper,
salt, and a little parsley. Stir and toss for three minutes.
Have ready to your hand some slices of buttered toast (cut
round with a tin cake-cutter before they are toasted);
spread thickly with ground or minced tongue, chicken, or
ham. Heap the stirred egg upon these in mounds, and set
in a hot dish garnished with parsley and pickled beets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs au Lit</span> (<i>in bed</i>). ✠</h3>

<p>Mince some cold fowl—chicken, turkey, or duck (or
some cold boiled veal and ham in equal quantities)—very
fine, and rub in a Wedgewood mortar, adding by degrees
some melted butter, pepper, salt, minced parsley, and two
beaten eggs. Warm in a frying-pan when it is well mixed,
stirring in a little hot water should it dry too fast. Cook
five minutes, stirring to keep it from scorching or browning.
Form, on a hot platter or flat dish, into a mound, flat
on top, with a ridge of the mixture running all around. It
is easily moulded with a broad-bladed knife. In the dish
thus formed, on the top of the mince-meat, lay as many
poached eggs as it will hold, sprinkling them with pepper
and salt. Arrange triangles of buttered toast in such
order, at the base of the mound, that they shall make a
pointed wall against it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil six or eight eggs hard; leave in cold water until
they are cold; cut in halves, slicing a bit off the bottoms
to make them stand upright, <i>à la</i> Columbus. Extract the
yolks, and rub to a smooth paste with a very little melted
butter, some cayenne pepper, a touch of mustard, and just
a dash of vinegar. Fill the hollowed whites with this, and
send to table upon a bed of chopped cresses, seasoned with
pepper, salt, vinegar, and a little sugar. The salad should
be two inches thick, and an egg be served with a heaping
tablespoonful of it. You may use lettuce or white cabbage
instead of cresses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg-Baskets.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make these for breakfast the day after you have had
roast chicken, duck, or turkey for dinner. Boil six eggs
hard, cut neatly in half and extract the yolks. Rub these
to a paste with some melted butter, pepper, and salt,
and set aside. Pound the minced meat of the cold fowl
fine in the same manner, and mix with the egg-paste, moistening
with melted butter as you proceed, or with a little
gravy, if you have it to spare. Cut off a slice from the
bottoms of the hollowed whites of the egg, to make them
stand; fill with the paste; arrange close together upon a
flat dish, and pour over them the gravy left from yesterday’s
roast, heated boiling hot, and mellowed by a few
spoonfuls of cream or rich milk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette</span> (<i>plain</i>). ✠</h3>

<p>Beat six eggs very light, the whites to a stiff froth that
will stand alone, the yolks to a smooth thick batter. Add
to the yolks a small cupful of milk, pepper, and salt;
lastly stir in the whites lightly. Have ready in a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
frying-pan a good lump of butter. When it hisses, pour
in your mixture gently and set over a clear fire. It
should cook in ten minutes at most. Do not stir, but
contrive, as the eggs “set,” to slip a broad-bladed knife
under the omelette to guard against burning at the bottom.
The instant “hiss” of the butter as it flows to the
hottest part of the pan will prove the wisdom and efficacy
of the precaution. If your oven is hot, you may put the
frying-pan into it as soon as the middle of the omelette is
set. When done, lay a hot dish bottom upward on the
top of the pan, and dexterously upset the latter to bring
the browned side of the omelette uppermost. Eat soon,
or it will fall.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> these directions to be worthy of note. I have
never seen lighter or better omelettes anywhere than in
households where these have been the rule for years in the
manufacture of this simple and delightful article of food.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette with Ham, Tongue, or Chicken.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make precisely as above; but when it is done, scatter
thickly over the surface some minced ham, tongue, or
seasoned chicken, slip your broad knife under one side of
the omelette and double in half, enclosing the meat.
Then upset the frying-pan upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You can stir the minced meat into the omelette after all
the ingredients are put together, adding, if you like, some
chopped parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower Omelette.</span></h3>

<p>Chop some cold cauliflower very fine, and mix in when
your omelette is ready to go into the pan. Season highly
with cayenne pepper and salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus Omelette.</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made of the tops only, minced and seasoned, and stirred
in as is the cauliflower. <i>Tomato omelette</i> has stewed tomato
spread over the surface, and is then doubled in half.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg-balls for Soup.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Rub the yolks of three or four hard-boiled eggs to a
smooth paste with a <i>very</i> little melted butter, pepper, and
salt. To these add two raw ones, beaten light, and enough
flour to hold the paste together. Mince into balls with
floured hands and set in a cool place until just before your
soup comes off, when put in carefully and boil one minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette aux Fines Herbes.</span></h3>

<p>After the yolks and whites are mixed together with the
milk, stir in, with two or three strokes of the spoon or
whisk, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, green thyme,
and sweet marjoram, with pepper and salt. Fry instantly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Omelettes.</span></h3>

<p>Grate some rich old cheese, and having mixed the omelette
as usual, stir in the cheese with a swift turn or two
of the whisk, and at the same time some chopped parsley
and thyme. If you beat long the cheese will separate the
milk from the eggs. Cook at once.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Make the omelette in the usual way; grate cheese upon it
and fold it over.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Omelettes.</span></h3>


<h4><i>Omelette Soufflée</i>—(<i>Fried.</i>)</h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls sugar (powdered.)</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of vanilla.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Beat the whites and yolks separately. Add the sugar
to the yolks, a little at a time, beating very thoroughly,
until they are smooth and thick. The whites should stand
alone. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan,
heat to boiling, and when you have added the vanilla to
the omelette, pour it in and cook very quickly, as you
would a plain one. Slip the knife frequently under it, to
loosen from the sides and bottom. It is more apt to scorch
than an omelette without sugar. Turn out upon a <i>very</i>
hot dish, sift powdered sugar over the top, and serve instantly,
or it will fall and become heavy.</p>


<h4><i>Omelette Soufflée</i>—(<i>Baked.</i>)</h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon and half the peel, grated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks and whites separately and very well. Add
to the yolks by degrees the powdered sugar, and beat until
it ceases to froth, and is thick and smooth. The whites
should be stiff enough to cut with a knife. Stir together
lightly with the seasoning, pour into a well-buttered dish,
and bake in a quick oven five or six minutes. The dish
should be warmed when it is buttered, not to chill the
eggs. Send around with a spoon, and let each one help
himself before it can fall.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Omelette.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 large pippins.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>8 eggs.</li>
<li>5 or 6 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>Nutmeg to taste.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful rose-water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Stew the apples, when you have pared and cored them,
as for apple-sauce. Beat them very smooth while hot,
adding the butter, sugar, and nutmeg. When perfectly
cold, put with the eggs, which should be whipped light,
yolks and whites separately. Put in the yolks first, then
the rose-water, lastly the whites, and pour into a deep
bake-dish, which has been warmed and buttered. Bake
in a moderate oven until it is delicately browned. Eat
warm—not hot—for tea, with Graham bread. It is better
for children—I say nothing of their elders—than cake
and preserves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette with Jelly.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Currant or other tart jelly.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls cream, or the same of milk, thickened with a teaspoonful of rice-flour or arrow-root.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful bitter almond or vanilla flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat whites and yolks separately, adding to the latter
the sugar and milk after they are thick and smooth.
Next, chop in the seasoning; lastly, stir in the whites with
a few swift strokes. Put a large spoonful of butter in the
frying-pan, and, when it is hot, pour in the omelette.
Spread upon it when done, which will be in a very few
minutes, some nice jelly. Take the pan from the fire to
do this, spread quickly, slip your knife or tin spatula under
one-half of the omelette, and double it over. Turn
over on a hot platter, sift powdered sugar upon it, and eat
at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milk, Butter, Cheese, etc.</span></h3>

<p>A cool cellar is the best place in which to keep milk,
if you have no dairy or milk-room. Strain it into broad
shallow pans, which are lukewarm from recent scalding.
You can get them made in one piece, with no seams in
which sour cream or dirt may lurk unsuspected. Set upon
swing shelves, to avoid the possibilities of drowned mice,
and keep the cellar dark to save it from flies. In twelve
hours skim for the table, and, unless you have need of the
milk, let it stand twelve hours more for the second rising
of cream. Put this into the stone jar or crock in which
the cream is kept for churning. Even in butter-making, I
have found it a good plan to take off at night the cream
clean from the morning churning, instead of letting it
stand twenty-four hours, as is the usual custom. The
“second rising” will repay one for the additional trouble.
Churn as soon as convenient after the cream “loppers” or
thickens. If it stands too long, it becomes bitter or musty.
The churn should be well scalded and aired between the
churnings. Scrupulous cleanliness should be the unbending
rule of dairy arrangements. All strongly-flavored
substances must be kept from the neighborhood of milk
and butter. They are ready absorbents, and when they
contract odor or taste, never get rid of it. Have earthen
and tin milk vessels, and never allow them to be put to
any other use.</p>

<p>Scald the churn, and cool with ice or spring water;
pour in the thick cream. Churn rather fast, until the butter-flakes,
left by the dasher upon the top, show that the
end to be gained is near—then more slowly. The motion
should always be regular. In warm weather pour a little
cold water into the churn, should the butter come slowly.
Take it up with the perforated dasher, turning it dexterously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
just below the surface of the butter-milk, to catch
every stray bit. Have ready some clean, <i>very</i> cold water,
in a deep wooden tray, and into this plunge the dasher
when you draw it from the churn. The butter will float
off, leaving the dasher free. Having collected every particle,
gather behind a wooden butter-shovel and drain off
the water, squeezing and pressing the butter with the shovel.
Set in a cool place for an hour to harden—a necessary measure
in summer—then work and knead it with a wooden
ladle until not another drop of water exudes, and the butter
is like yellow marble in polish and closeness of pores.
When you have worked out the butter-milk, add by degrees
fine salt in the proportion of a dessertspoonful to every
pound. Then set aside for some hours, <i>always</i> in a cool
place. The last working is a slight affair, comparatively.
Still using the paddle, and never, from beginning to end
of the operation, touching with your hands, mould into
rolls or pound “pats.” Mark with grooves or checkers
with the ladle, or stamp with a print. Wrap each roll in
a clean wet linen cloth, which has no touch of soap or
starch about it, and pack in a stone jar, sprinkling a little
salt between the layers.</p>

<p>If you wish to keep it a long time, work with especial
care, and pack down <i>hard</i> in a perfectly clean stone jar.
Do not, above all things, take one that has ever been used
for pickles. You may not detect the faintest odor lingering
about it, but the butter will, and absorb it, too. Some
cover the butter with strong brine, but a better way is to
press a fine linen cloth closely to the surface, and cover
this with a thick layer of clean fine salt. Set in a cool,
dry place, and keep the cloth over it all the time; also a
tightly-fitting lid. When you begin to use it, take out
enough to last a week, and re-cover. If you admit the air
every day, it is apt to grow strong. A pretty plate of butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for the table is made of balls half the size of an egg,
rolled in the little fluted paddles sold for the purpose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bonny-Clabber, or Loppered-Milk.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Set a china or glass dish of skimmed milk away in a
warm place, covered. When it turns—<i>i. e.</i>, becomes a
smooth, firm, but not tough cake, like blanc-mange—serve
in the same dish. Cut out carefully with a large spoon,
and put in saucers, with cream, powdered sugar, and nutmeg
to taste. It is better, if set on the ice for an hour before
it is brought to table. Do not let it stand until the
whey separates from the curd.</p>

<p>Few people know how delicious this healthful and cheap
dessert can be made, if eaten before it becomes tart and
tough, with a liberal allowance of cream and sugar.
There are not many jellies and creams superior to it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rennet.</span></h3>

<p>Clean the stomach of a calf (or have your butcher do it
for you) as soon as it is killed, scouring inside and out
with salt. When perfectly clean, tack upon a frame to
dry in the sun for a day. Cut in squares, and pack down
in salt, or keep in wine or brandy. When you wish to use
the salted, soak half an hour in cold water, wash well, and
put into the milk to be turned, tied to a string, that it
may be drawn out without breaking the curd. The liquor
rennet sold by druggists is sometimes good, quite as often
worthless. You can, however, get the dried or salted in
the markets, and often in the drug-stores.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mountain Custard, or Junket.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Take a piece of rennet an inch long, or a teaspoonful
of the wine in which rennet is kept, to each quart of milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Season with vanilla or lemon, a little nutmeg, and a tablespoonful
of sugar to each part. More will retard the
formation. Set in a warm place—near the fire, or on the
kitchen table—closely covered. Look at it from time to
time, and if, in the course of an hour, there are no signs
of stiffening, add more rennet. When it is firm, like
blanc-mange, and before the whey separates from the
curd, remove the rennet, and set upon ice until it is
wanted. Serve with powdered sugar and cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thickened Milk.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a quart of milk, add a very little salt, and two
tablespoonfuls of rice or wheat flour wet in cold milk.
Stir in smoothly, and let it thicken in a vessel of boiling
water, keeping the outer saucepan at a hard boil for half
an hour. Eat with butter and sugar, or with cream and
sugar. For invalids, or children who are suffering with
summer disorders, boil at least an hour, stirring very often.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Cheese.</span></h2>

<p>I have doubted the utility of inserting a receipt for
regular cheese-making. The apparatus necessary for the
manufacture is seldom, if ever, found in a private family,
while cheese can be had in every country store at one-third
the expense to an amateur of making it. But, remembering
that it may be a pleasant, if not profitable
experiment, for the mistress of many cows to make at her
odd moments, I have secured what purports to be an
exact description of “cheese-making on a small scale.”</p>

<p>To each gallon of milk warm from the cow, add a piece of
rennet six inches long and three wide, or two tablespoonfuls
rennet water—<i>i. e.</i>, water in which rennet has been boiled.
Cover, and set in a warm place until it becomes a firm curd;
this should be, at the most, not more than three-quarters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
an hour. When the whey has separated entirely, and looks
clear and greenish, wash your hands very clean, and with
them gently press all the curd to one side of the pan or tub,
while an assistant dips out the whey. Have ready a stout
linen bag, pour the curd into it, and hang it up to dry
until not another drop of whey can be pressed out; then
put the curd into a wooden dish, and chop it fine. Empty
into a finer bag, and put into a small cheese-box, or other
circular wooden box with a perforated bottom, and a lid
that slides down easily but closely on the inside. Your
bag should be as nearly as possible the same shape and
size as this box. Lay heavy weights upon the top, in lack
of a cheese-press, and let it stand an hour. The cloth
should be wet <i>inside</i> as well as out, before you put the
curds in. At the end of the hour, take out the cheese
and chop again, adding salt this time. Have ready a fresh
wet cloth; pack in the curd hard. There should be a circular
cover for this bag, which must be basted all around,
and very smooth on top. Scald the box and cover, then
rinse with cold water, and put the cheese again under
press for twelve hours. Next day, take it out, rub all
over with salt, and fit on a clean wet cloth. Look at it
sixteen hours later, pare off the rough edges, and scrape
the sides of inequalities before returning to the press for
the last time. Let it remain under the weights for twenty-four
hours. Strip off the cloth, rub the cheese well with
butter, and lay upon a clean cloth spread on a shelf in a
cool, dry place. A wire-safe is best. Wipe clean; then
rub every day with butter for a week, and turn also every
twenty-four hours. At the end of the week, omit the
greasing, and rub hard with a coarse cloth. Do this every
day for a month. Your cheese will then be eatable, but
it will be much finer six months later.</p>

<p>Stilton cheeses—renowned over the world—are buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in dry heather when they are firm enough to remove from
the shelves, and kept there a month. This is called
“ripening.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Heat sour milk until the whey rises to the top. Pour
it off, put the curd in a bag and let it drip six hours, without
squeezing it. Put in a wooden bowl, chop fine with a
wooden spoon, salt to taste, and work to the consistency of
soft putty, adding a little cream and butter as you proceed.
Mould with your hands into round “pats” or balls,
and keep in a cool place. It is best when fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Stir a little salt into a pan of “loppered” cream. Pour
into a linen bag, and let it drain three days, changing the
bag every day. Then pack into a wooden cup or mould
with holes in the bottom, and press two hours. Wet the
mould with cold water before putting in the cream-curd.
Wrapped in soft white paper—two or three folds of tissue
paper will do—to exclude the air, they will keep in a cool
place for a week.</p>

<p>This is the cheese sold in this country under the name
of <i>Neufchatel</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="BREAD"></a>BREAD.</h2>


<p>If eminence of importance entitled a subject to pre-eminence
of position, that of which we are now about to
speak should have stood foremost in this work. It is not
a pleasant thing to think or write about, but it is a stubborn
fact, that upon thousands of tables, in otherwise comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
homes, <i>good</i> bread is an unknown phenomenon.
I say phenomenon, because it would indeed be a marvellous
estrangement of cause and effect were indifferent flour,
unskillfully mixed with flat yeast, badly risen and negligently
baked, to result in that pride of the notable housekeeper—light,
sweet, wholesome bread. I know a household
where sour, stiff bread is the rule, varied several
times during the week by muffins scented and colored
with soda, clammy biscuit, and leathery griddle-cakes;
another where the bread is invariably over-risen, and
consequently tasteless, sometimes slightly acid; yet
another in which home-made bread is not used at all
because it is “so troublesome and uncertain,” the mistress
preferring to feed her family, growing children and all,
upon the vari-colored sponges bought at the bakers—sponges
inflated with sal volatile, flavorless, and dry as
chips when a day old, and too often betraying, in the
dark streaks running through the interior of the loaf,
want of cleanliness in the kneader. Yet these are all
well-to-do people, who submit to these abominations partly
because they do not know how badly off they are—chiefly
because it is their way of doing, and they see no reason
for changing. “I have been a housekeeper for thirty
years, and have always mixed my bread just so,” retorted
a mistress once, when I mildly set forth the advantages of
“setting a sponge” over-night. “I put in flour, yeast,
and milk if I have it, and give them a good stir; then
set the dough down to rise. Our folks don’t fancy very
light bread. There don’t seem to be any substance in it—so
to speak. Mine generally turns out pretty nice. It’s
all luck, after all, about bread.”</p>

<p>“I’m told you have a receipt for making bread,”
laughed another to me; “I never heard of such a thing
in my life, and I’ve been keeping house eighteen years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
So I thought I’d call and ask you for it—just as a curiosity,
you know. I want to see what it is like.”</p>

<p>I wisely kept <i>my</i> thoughts to myself, and dictated the
receipt, which she jotted down in a memorandum-book
laughing all the while at the “excellent joke.”</p>

<p>“You really use this?” she demanded, when this was
done.</p>

<p>“I do. I have used no other for many years.”</p>

<p>“And the bread I ate upon your table, the other night,
was made according to this?”</p>

<p>Again an affirmative answer.</p>

<p>“I guess your cook could tell another story,” rejoined
the skeptic. “You can’t make me believe that bread is
made by rule. I put my materials together anyhow, and
I have as good luck as most of my neighbors.”</p>

<p>I regarded my visitor as an impertinent simpleton; but
I have been amazed, in subsequent years, at finding that
her creed is that of hundreds of housewives more or less
sensible. “Luck” rules the baking, and upon the shoulders
of this Invisible are laid the deficiencies of the
complacent cook. Cheap flour and laziness are at the
bottom of more mishaps in the bread line than any other
combination of circumstances. From the inferior grades
of flour, it is possible to make tolerable biscuit, crumpets,
and muffins, plain pastry, and very good griddle-cakes.
You cannot, by any stretch of art, produce excellent
bread from poor flour. It is no economy to purchase it
for this purpose. It <i>is</i> judicious to lay in two barrels at a
time, and to use the best only for the semi- or tri-weekly
baking.</p>

<p>Chiefest then among the conditions to good bread, I
place good “family” flour—dry, elastic, and odorless.
Whiteness is a secondary consideration, although, to
American eyes, this is a recommendation. A little experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
will teach you to detect the signs that foretell
satisfactory baking-days, and <i>vice versâ</i>. If in handling
the flour you discern a heaviness like that of ground
plaster; if in squeezing a handful tightly you discover
that it retains the imprint of palm and fingers, and rolls
back into the tray a compact ball or roll; if it is in the
least musty, or sour, use it very sparingly in your trial-baking,
for the chances are as ten to one that you will
head the barrel up again and return it to your grocer.</p>

<p>Sometimes new flour can be ripened for use by sifting
enough for each baking into a large tray, and exposing
it to the hot sun for some hours, or by setting it upon the
kitchen hearth for the same time. And it not unfrequently
happens that flour improves greatly after the
barrel has been open for several days or weeks. It dries
out and becomes lighter, more elastic. Next in importance
to the quality of the flour is that of the yeast. This
should be light in color and lively, effervescing easily
when shaken, and emitting an odor like weak ammonia.
If dull or sour, it is bad. In cities it is easiest, perhaps
cheapest, to buy yeast from a brewery or bakery, exercising
your discrimination as to quality. Unless you can
satisfy yourself in this regard, you had better make your
own. I can confidently recommend the receipts given
in this work as easy and safe, having tried them in my
own family.</p>

<p>Novices in bread-making, and many who should have
learned better by long experience, fall into a sad mistake
in the consistency of the dough. It should be mixed as
<i>soft as it can be handled</i>. Bread will rise sooner and
higher, be lighter and more digestible, and keep fresh
much longer, if this rule be followed. Stiff bread is close
in texture, often waxy to the teeth, and after a day or so
becomes very hard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Set the dough to rise in a moderately warm place, and
keep it in an even temperature. There is force in the old
lament—“My bread took cold, last night.” Cold arrests
the process of fermentation. There is a chance, should
this occur, that a removal to a more genial atmosphere
and careful nursing may cure the congestion, should it be
only partial. Too much heat carries forward the work
too rapidly. In this case, you will find your dough puffy
and sour. Correct the latter evil by dissolving a little
soda or saleratus in hot water, and working it well in.</p>

<p>Knead your bread faithfully and from all sides, until it
rebounds like india-rubber after a smart blow of the fist
upon the centre of the mass.</p>

<p>The oven should not be too hot. If you cannot hold
your bare arm within it while you count thirty, it is too
quick. Keep the heat steady after the bread goes in.
Too much fire at first, and rapidly cooling, produce the
effect upon the bread which is technically called “slack-baked,”
<i>i. e.</i>, the inside of the loaf is never properly done.
Practice and intelligent observation will, in time, make
you an adept in the management of your ovens. If the
bread rises rapidly while baking, and the crust begins to
form before the lower part of the loaf is baked, cover the
top with clean paper until you are ready to brown it.</p>

<p>Grate away the burned portions of the crust, should
there be such. This is better than chipping with a knife.
One of the best bread-makers I know bakes in round
pans, each loaf by itself, and grates the whole outer surface,
top, bottom, and sides, quickly and lightly, toning
down the brown to a uniform and pleasing tint. Tilt
your loaves upon the edge, the lower part resting upon
the table, the upper supported by the wall or other upright
object, and throw a coarse dry cloth over them until
they cool. This position allows the air to get at all sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and prevents “sweating.” A tin bread-box is best, with
a cloth at bottom and enwrapping the loaves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yeast</span> (<i>Hop.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 large potatoes, or six small.</li>
<li>2 quarts cold water.</li>
<li>Double handful hops, tied in a coarse muslin bag.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel the potatoes, and put them with the hop-bag into
a saucepan containing two quarts cold water. Cover and
boil until the potatoes break and fall apart. Take these
out with a perforated skimmer, leaving the water still
boiling, mash them fine with a potato-beetle, and work in
the flour and sugar. Moisten this gradually with the
<i>boiling</i> hop tea, stirring it to a smooth paste. When all
the tea has been mixed in, set it aside to cool. While
still slightly warm, add four tablespoonfuls of lively
yeast, and turn all into a large open vessel to “work.”
Keep this in a warm place until it ceases to bubble up,
or until next day. In summer it will work well in a
few hours. When quite light, put in earthen jars with
small mouths, in which fit corks, or bottle it, and remove
to ice-house or cellar. It will keep good for a fortnight—longer
in winter.</p>

<p>When you wish to use it for baking, send a small vessel
to the cellar for the desired quantity, and re-cork at
once. A half-hour in a hot kitchen may spoil it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yeast</span> (<i>Self-working</i>).</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>8 potatoes.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>2 ounces hops.</li>
<li>4 quarts cold water.</li>
<li>1 lb. flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. white sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tie the hops in a coarse muslin bag, and boil one hour
in four quarts of water. Let it cool to lukewarmness before
removing the bag. Wet with the tepid liquor—a little
at a time—the flour, making to a smooth paste. Put
in the sugar and salt, beat up the batter three minutes before
adding the rest of the tea. Set it away for two days
in an open bowl covered with a thin cloth, in a closet
which is moderately and evenly warm.</p>

<p>On the third day peel, boil, and mash the potatoes, and
when entirely free from lumps and specks, stir in gradually
the thickened hop-liquor. Let it stand twelve hours
longer in the bowl, stirring often, and keeping it in the
warm kitchen. Then bottle or put away in corked jars,
which must be perfectly sweet and freshly scalded. This
will keep a month in a cool cellar. It is more troublesome
to make it than other kinds of yeast, but it needs no
other “rising” to excite fermentation, and remains good
longer than that made in the usual way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yeast</span> (<i>Potato.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 potatoes.</li>
<li>2 quarts cold water.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel and boil the potatoes until they break. Leaving
the water on the fire, take them out and mash fine with
the flour and sugar, wetting gradually with the hot water
until it is all used. When lukewarm, add a gill of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
yeast, and set aside in an open vessel and warm place to
ferment. When it ceases to effervesce, bottle and set in
ice-house.</p>

<p>This yeast is very nice and white, and is preferred by
many who dislike the bitter taste of hops. It is also convenient
to make when hops cannot be obtained.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yeast Cakes.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 quarts water (cold.)</li>
<li>1 quart pared and sliced potatoes.</li>
<li>Double-handful hops, tied in coarse muslin bag.</li>
<li>Flour to make stiff batter.</li>
<li>1 cup Indian meal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the potatoes and hop-bag in two quarts of water
for three-quarters of an hour. Remove the hops, and while
boiling hot, strain the potatoes and water through a cullender
into a bowl. Stir into the scalding liquor enough
flour to make a stiff batter. Beat all up well; add two
tablespoonfuls lively yeast and set in a warm place to
rise. When light, stir in a cup of Indian meal, roll into
a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, and cut into round
cakes. Dry these in the hot sun, or in a <i>very</i> moderate
oven, taking care they do not heat to baking. It is best to
put them in after the fire has gone down for the night,
and leave them in until morning. When entirely dry
and cold, hang them up in a bag in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>Use one cake three inches in diameter for a loaf of fair
size; soak in tepid water until soft, and add a pinch of
soda or saleratus, then mix.</p>

<p>These cakes will remain good a month in summer, two
in winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baking Powders.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Sponge</span> (<i>Potato.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 potatoes, boiled and mashed fine while hot.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls baker’s yeast.</li>

<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard.</li>
<li>1 even teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>1 quart warm—<i>not</i> hot—water.</li>
<li>3 cups flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mash the potatoes, and work in the lard and sugar.
Stir to a cream, mixing in gradually a quart of the water
in which the potatoes were boiled, which should have been
poured out to cool down to blood warmth. <i>Beat</i> in the
flour, already wet up with a little potato-water to prevent
lumping, then the yeast, lastly the soda. Cover lightly
if the weather is warm, more closely in winter, and set to
rise over night in a warm place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Sponge</span> (<i>Plain.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart warm water.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>6 tablespoonfuls baker’s yeast.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>Flour to make a soft batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the lard in the warm water, add the sugar, then the
flour by degrees, stirring in smoothly. A quart and a pint
of flour will usually be sufficient if the quality is good.
Next comes the yeast, lastly the soda. Beat up hard for
several minutes, and set to rise as above.</p>

<p>Bread mixed with potato-sponge is more nutritious,
keeps fresh longer, and is sweeter than that made with the
plainer sponge, But there are certain seasons of the year
when good <i>old</i> potatoes cannot be procured, and new ones
will not do for this purpose.</p>

<p>The potato-sponge is safer, because surer for beginners
in the important art of bread-making. After using it for
fifteen years, I regard it as almost infallible—given the
conditions of good flour, yeast, kneading, and baking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family Bread</span> (<i>White.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Having set your sponge over night, or, if you bake late
in the afternoon, early in the morning, sift dry flour into a
deep bread-tray, and strew a few spoonfuls of fine salt over
it. The question of the quantity of flour is a delicate one,
requiring judgment and experience. Various brands of
flour are so unequal with respect to the quantity of gluten
they contain, that it is impossible to give any invariable
rule on this subject. It will be safe, however, to sift two
quarts and a pint, if you have set the potato-sponge; two
quarts for the plain. This will make two good-sized loaves.
Make a hole in the middle of the heap, pour in the risen
sponge (which should be very light and seamed in many
places on the top), and work down the flour into it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
your hands. If too soft, add more flour. If you can
mould it at all, it is not too soft. If stiff, rinse out the
bowl in which the sponge was set with a little lukewarm
water, and work this in. When you have it in manageable
shape, begin to knead. Work the mass into a ball—your
hands having been well floured from the first; detach
it from the tray, and lift it in your left hand, while you
sprinkle flour with the right thickly over the bottom and
sides of the tray. Toss back the ball into this, and knead
hard—always toward the centre of the mass, which should
be repeatedly turned over and around, that every portion
may be manipulated. Brisk and long kneading makes the
pores fine and regular. Gaping holes of diverse sizes are
an unerring tell-tale of a careless cook. Spend at least twenty
minutes—half an hour is better—in this kind of useful
gymnastics. It is grand exercise for arms and chest. This
done, work the dough into a shapely ball in the centre of
the tray, sprinkle flour over the top; throw a cloth over
all and leave it on the kitchen-table to rise, taking care it
is not in a draught of cold air. In summer, it will rise in
four or five hours—in winter, six are often necessary. It
should come up steadily until it at least trebles its original
bulk and the floured surface cracks all over. Knead again
for ten or fifteen minutes. Then, divide it into as many
parts as you wish loaves, and put these in well-greased pans
for the final rising. In a large household baking, it is customary
to mould the dough into oblong rolls, three or four,
according to the number of loaves you desire, and to lay
these close together in one large pan. The second kneading
is done upon a floured board, and should be thorough
as the first, the dough being continually shifted and turned.
Set the pans in a warm place for an hour longer, with a
cloth thrown over them to keep out the air and dust. Then
bake, heeding the directions set down in the article upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
bread in general. If your ovens are in good condition,
one hour should bake the above quantity of bread. But
here again experience must be your guide. Note carefully
for yourself how long a time is required for your first
successful baking, as also how much dry flour you have
worked into your sponge, and let these data regulate
future action. I have known a variation of two quarts in
a large baking, over the usual measure of flour. I need not
tell you that you had better shun a brand that requires such
an excessive quantity to bring the dough to the right consistency.
It is neither nutritious nor economical. When
you make out the loaves, prick the top with the fork.</p>

<p>Do not make your first baking too large. Practice is
requisite to the management of an unwieldy mass of
dough. Let your trial-loaf be with say half the quantity
of sponge and flour I have set down, and increase these
as skill and occasion require, carefully preserving the
proportions. Seven or eight quarts of flour will be needed
for the semi-weekly baking of a family of moderate size.</p>

<p>If I have seemed needlessly minute in the directions I
have laid down, it is because I wish to be a guide,
not a betrayer, and because I am deeply impressed with
the worth of such advice as may tend to diminish the
number of those who know not for themselves the comfort
and delight of eating from day to day, and year to year,
good family bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family Bread</span> (<i>Brown.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>I wish it were in my power, by much and earnest
speaking and writing, to induce every housekeeper to
make brown bread—that is, bread made of unbolted, usually
called Graham flour—a staple article of diet in her
family. I only repeat the declaration of a majority of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
best chemists and physicians when I say that our American
fondness for fine white bread is a serious injury to our
health. We bolt and rebolt our flour until we extract
from it three-quarters of its nutritive qualities, leaving little
strength in it except what lies in gluten or starch, and
consign that which makes bone and tissue, which regulates
the digestive organs, and leaves the blood pure, the
brain clear, to the lower animals. Growing children
especially should eat brown bread daily. It supplies the
needed phosphate to the tender teeth and bones. If properly
made, it soon commends itself to their taste, and
white becomes insipid in comparison. Dyspeptics have long
been familiar with its dietetic virtues, and, were the use
of it more general, we should have fewer wretches to
mourn over the destroyed coats of their stomachs. It is
wholesome, sweet, honest, and should be popular.</p>

<p>Prepare a sponge as for white bread, using potatoes or
while flour. My rule is to take out a certain quantity of
the risen sponge on baking day, and set aside for brown
bread. Put into a tray two parts Graham flour, one-third
white, and to every quart of this allow a handful of Indian
meal, with a teaspoonful of salt. Wet this up with the
sponge, and when it is mixed, add, for a loaf of fair size,
half a teacupful of molasses. The dough should be <i>very</i>
soft. If there is not enough of the sponge to reduce it to
the desired consistency, add a little blood-warm water.
Knead it diligently and long. It will not rise so rapidly
as the white flour, having more “body” to carry. Let it
take its time; make into round, comfortable loaves, and
set down again for the second rising, when you have
again kneaded it. Bake steadily, taking care it does not
burn, and do not cut while hot. The result will well repay
you for your trouble. It will take a longer time to bake
than white bread. Brown flour should not be sifted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boston Brown Bread.</span></h3>

<p>Set a sponge over night, with potatoes or white flour,
in the following proportions:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup yeast.</li>
<li>6 potatoes, mashed fine with three cups of flour.</li>
<li>1 quart warm water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard (<i>or</i>, if you leave out the potatoes, one quart of warm water to three pints of flour).</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat up well and let it rise five or six hours.</p>

<p>When light, sift into the bread-tray—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart rye-flour.</li>
<li>2 quarts Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, or saleratus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix this up very soft with the risen sponge, adding
warm water, if needed, and working in gradually</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Half a teacupful of molasses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knead well, and let it rise from six to seven hours.
Then work over again, and divide into loaves, putting
these in well-greased, round, deep pans. The second rising
should last an hour, at the end of which time bake in a
moderate oven about four hours. Rapid baking will ruin
it. If put in late in the day, let it stay in the oven all
night.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rye Bread.</span></h3>

<p>Set a sponge, as above, but with half the quantity of
water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning mix with this:</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart warm milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 cup Indian meal.</li>
<li>And enough rye flour to make it into pliable dough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed as with wheat bread, baking it a little longer.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that acidity, greater or less,
is the normal state of rye bread. If you find your dough
in the slightest degree sour, correct by adding a teaspoonful
of soda dissolved in warm water. It is safest to add
this always in warm weather.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milk Bread.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>½ teacupful of yeast.</li>
<li>¼ lb. butter, one tablespoonful white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir into the milk, which should be made blood-warm,
a pint of flour, the sugar, lastly the yeast. Beat all together
well, and let them rise five or six hours. Then
melt the butter, and add with a little salt. Work in flour
enough to make a stiff dough; let this rise four hours,
and make into small loaves. Set near the fire for half an
hour, and bake.</p>

<p>In warm weather, add a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved
in warm water, to the risen sponge, as all bread mixed
with milk is apt to sour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttermilk Bread.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint buttermilk heated to scalding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir in, while it is hot, enough flour to make a tolerably
thick batter. Add half a gill of yeast, and let it rise five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
or six hours. If you make it over night you need not add
the yeast, but put in, instead, a tablespoonful of white
sugar. In the morning, stir into the sponge a tablespoonful
of soda, dissolved in hot water, a little salt, and two
tablespoonfuls melted butter. Work in just flour enough
to enable you to handle the dough comfortably; knead
well, make into loaves, and let it rise until light.</p>

<p>This makes very white and wholesome bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Bread.</span></h3>

<p>Make a sponge of—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart warm water.</li>
<li>1 teacupful yeast.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard.</li>
<li>1 quart wheat flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat well together, and when it has risen, which will
be in about five hours, add three pints of warm milk and
three teacupfuls rice-flour wet to a thin paste with cold
milk, and boiled four minutes as you would starch. This
should be a little more than blood-warm when it is stirred
into the batter. If not thick enough to make out into
dough, add a little wheat-flour. Knead thoroughly, and
treat as you would wheat bread in the matter of the two
risings and baking.</p>

<p>This is nice and delicate for invalids, and keeps well.
If you cannot procure the rice-flour, boil one cup of
whole rice to a thin paste, mashing and beating it smooth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Rolls.</span> (<i>No. 1.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>In kneading dough for the day’s baking, after adding
and working in the risen sponge, set aside enough for a
loaf of tea-rolls. Work into this a heaping tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of lard or butter, and let it stand in a tolerably cool place
(not a cold or draughty one) for four hours. Knead it
again, and let it alone for three hours longer. Then make
into rolls, by rolling out, <i>very</i> lightly, pieces of the dough
into round cakes, and folding these, not quite in the
centre, like turn-overs. The third rising will be for one
hour, then bake steadily half an hour or less, if the oven
is quick.</p>

<p>Having seen these rolls, smoking, light, and delicious,
upon my own table, at least twice a week for ten years,
with scarcely a failure in the mixing or baking, I can
confidently recommend the receipt and the product.
You can make out part of your Graham dough in the
same manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Rolls.</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk; new, warm milk is best.</li>
<li>1 teacup yeast.</li>
<li>1 quart and a pint of flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>When this sponge is light, work in a well-beaten egg
and two tablespoonfuls melted butter, with a teaspoonful
of salt, half a teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water,
one tablespoonful white sugar and enough white flour to
make a soft dough. Let this stand four or five hours,
roll out into round cakes and fold as in No. 1, or shape
with your hands into balls. Set these closely together
in the baking-pan; let them rise one hour, and just before
putting them into the oven, cut deeply across each
ball with a sharp knife. This will make the cleft roll, so
familiar to us in French restaurants. Bake half an hour.</p>

<li>2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>Flour to make a soft dough.</li>

three-quarters of an inch in thickness; cut into round
cakes, set these closely together in a pan, let them rise

<p>These delightful biscuits are even better if the above
ingredients be set with half as much flour, in the form of
a thin sponge, and the rest of the flour be worked in five
hours later. Let this rise five hours more, and proceed
as already directed. This is the best plan if the biscuits
are intended for tea.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>2 heaping tablespoonfuls of lard.</li>
<li>2 cups sweet—if you can get it—<i>new</i> milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonful cream-tartar.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the soda and cream-tartar into the flour, and sift
all together before they are wet; then put in the salt;
next the lard, rubbed into the prepared flour quickly and
lightly; lastly, pour in the milk. Work out the dough
rapidly, kneading with as few strokes as possible, since
handling injures the biscuit. If properly prepared the
dough will have a rough surface and the biscuit be flaky.
The dough should also be <i>very</i> soft. If the flour stiffen it
too much, add more milk. Roll out lightly, cut into
cakes at least half an inch thick, and bake in a quick
oven. The biscuit made by the friend from whom I had
this receipt were marvels of lightness and sweetness. I
have often thought of them since with regretful longing,
when set down to so-called “soda-biscuit,” marbled with
greenish-yellow streaks, and emitting, when split, an
odor which was in itself an eloquent dissuasive to an
educated appetite. Few cooks make really good, quick
biscuit—why, I am unable to say, unless upon the principle
of “brains will tell.” I have had more than one
in my kitchen, who, admirable in almost every other
respect, were absolutely unfit to be intrusted with this
simple yet delicate manufacture. The common fault is
to have too “heavy a hand” with soda, and to “guess at”
the quantities, instead of measuring them. Eat while
warm.</p>

<p>Flour to make soft dough—just stiff enough to handle.
Mix, roll, and cut out rapidly, with as little handling as

<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Wheatlets.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint Graham flour.</li>
<li>Nearly a quart of boiling water or milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>

<p>Scald the flour, when you have salted it, into as soft
dough as you can handle. Roll it nearly an inch thick,
cut in round cakes, lay upon a hot buttered tin or pan,
and bake them in the hottest oven you can get ready.
Everything depends upon heat in the manufacture of these.
Some cooks spread them on a hot tin, and set this upon a
red-hot stove. Properly scalded and cooked, they are
light as puffs, and very good; otherwise they are flat and
tough. Split and butter while hot.</p>

<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls yeast.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a sponge with the milk, yeast, and enough flour
for a thin batter, and let it rise over night. In the morning
add the butter, eggs, and sugar, previously beaten up
well together, the salt, and flour enough to make a soft
dough. Mould with the hands into balls of uniform size,
set close together in a pan, and let them rise until very
light. After baking, wash the tops with a clean soft cloth
dipped in molasses and water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dried Rusk.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of warm milk.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>½ teacup of butter.</li>
<li>Half a cup of yeast.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set a sponge with these ingredients, leaving out the
eggs, and stirring in flour until you have a thick batter.
Early next morning add the well-beaten eggs, and flour
enough to enable you to roll out the dough. Let this rise
in the bread-bowl two hours. Roll into a sheet nearly an
inch thick, cut into round cakes, and arrange in your
baking-pan two deep, laying one upon the other carefully.
Let these stand for another half-hour, and bake.</p>

<p>These are now very nice for eating, and you may, if
you like, reserve a plateful for tea; but the rule for the
many, handed down through, I am afraid to say how
many generations, in the family where I first ate this
novel and delightful biscuit, is to divide the twins, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
leaving one side of each cake soft, and piling them loosely
in the pan, set them in the oven when the fire is declining
for the night, and leave them in until morning. Then,
still obeying the traditions of revered elders, put them
in a clean muslin bag, and hang them up in the kitchen.
They will be fit to eat upon the third day. Put as many
as you need in a deep dish, and pour over them iced
milk, or water, if you cannot easily procure the former.
Let them soak until soft, take them out, drain them for a
minute in a shallow plate, and eat with butter. Invalids
and children crave them eagerly. Indeed, I have seen
few refuse them who had ever tasted them before. There
is a pastoral flavor about the pleasant dish, eaten with
the accompaniment of fresh berries, on a summer evening,
that appeals to the better impulses of one’s appetite.</p>

<p>Try my soaked rusk—not forgetting to ice the milk—and
you will find out for yourself what I mean, but
cannot quite express.</p>

<p>Dried rusk will keep for weeks, and grow better every
day. The only risk is in their being eaten up before they attain
maturity.</p>

<p>Rub the butter into the flour, or, what is better, cut it
up with a knife or chopper, as you do in pastry; add the
salt, milk, and soda, mixing well. Work into a ball, lay
upon a floured board, and beat with a rolling-pin half an
hour, turning and shifting the mass often. Roll into an
even sheet, a quarter of an inch thick, or less, prick deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>

thin, cut into round cakes, and again roll these as thin
as they can be handled. Lift them carefully, lay in a

<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Bread.</span></h3>

<p>There is a marked difference between the corn-meal
ground at the South, and that which is sent out from
Northern mills. If any one doubts this, it is not she who
has perseveringly tried both kinds, and demonstrated to
her own conviction that the same treatment will not do
for them. An intelligent lady once told me that the
shape of the particles composing the meal was different—the
one being round and smooth, the other angular. I
am inclined to believe this. The Southern meal is certainly
coarser, and the bread made from it less compact.
Moreover, there is a partiality at the North for yellow
meal, which the Southerners regard as only fit for chicken
and cattle-feed. The yellow may be the sweeter, but I
acknowledge that I have never succeeded in making
really nice bread from it.</p>

<p>Indian meal should be purchased in small quantities,
except for a very large family. It is apt to heat, mould,
and grow musty, if kept long in bulk or in a warm place.
If not sweet and dry, it is useless to expect good bread or
cakes. As an article of diet, especially in the early warm
days of spring, it is healthful and agreeable, often acting
as a gentle corrective to bile and other disorders. In
winter, also, it is always acceptable upon the breakfast
or supper table, being warming and nutritious. In
summer the free use of it is less judicious, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of its laxative properties. As a kindly variation in the
routine of fine white bread and baker’s rolls, it is worth the
attention of every housewife. “John and the children”
will like it, if it approximates the fair standard of
excellence; and I take it, my good friend—you who have
patiently kept company with me from our prefatory talk
until now—that you love them well enough to care for
their comfort and likings.</p>

<p>“My husband is wild about corn bread,” a wife remarked
to me not a hundred years ago, “but I won’t
make it for him; it is such a bother! And if I once
indulge him, he will give me no peace.”</p>

<p>Beloved sister, I am persuaded better things of you.
Good husbands cannot be spoiled by petting. Bad ones
cannot be made worse—they may be made better. It
seems a little thing, so trifling in its consequences, you
need not tire further your aching back and feet to accomplish
it—the preparation of John’s favorite dish when he
does not expect the treat—to surprise him when he comes
in cold and hungry, by setting before him a dish of hot
milk-toast, or a loaf of corn bread, brown and crisp without,
yellow and spongy within, instead of the stereotyped
pile of cold slices, brown or white. If he were consulted,
he would say, like the generous soul he is—“Don’t take
one needless step for me, dear.” And he would mean it.
But for all that, he will enjoy your little surprise—ay!
and love you the better for it. It is the “little by little”
that makes up the weal and woe of life.</p>

<p>May I make this digression longer yet, by telling you
what I overheard a husband say to a wife the other day
when he thought no one else was near enough to hear
him. He is no gourmand, but he is very partial to a
certain kind of cruller which nobody else can make, he
thinks, so well as his little wife. It so chanced that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
frying some of them, she scalded her hand badly. After
it was bandaged, she brought up a plate of the cakes for
luncheon. He looked at them, then at her, with a loving,
mournful smile.</p>

<p>“I can understand now,” said he, “how David felt
when his men-of-war brought him the water from the well
of Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>Then he stooped and kissed the injured fingers. Yet
he has been married twenty years. I was not ashamed
that my eyes were moist. I honored him the more that
his were dim.</p>

<p>This is my lesson by the wayside <i>apropos</i> to corn-bread.</p>

<p>And now again to business.</p>

<li>2 heaping tablespoonfuls lard, or butter, or half-and-half.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the meal with the boiling milk, and let it stand
until lukewarm. Then stir in the sugar, yeast, and salt,
and leave it to rise five hours. Add the melted shortening,
beat well, put in greased muffin-rings, set these near the
fire for fifteen minutes, and bake. Half an hour in a
quick oven ought to cook them.</p>

<p>Never cut open a muffin or crumpet of any kind, least of
all one made of Indian meal. Pass the knife lightly around
it to pierce the crust, then break open with the fingers.</p>



<h3><i>Receipts for Corn Bread made of Southern Indian Meal.</i></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Johnny Cake.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 teacupful sweet milk.</li>
<li>1 teacupful buttermilk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough meal to enable you to roll it into a sheet half
an inch thick. Spread upon a buttered tin, or in a shallow
pan, and bake forty minutes. As soon as it begins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
brown, baste it with a rag tied to a stick and dipped in
melted butter. Repeat this five or six times until it is
brown and crisp. Break—not cut it up—and eat for
luncheon or tea, accompanied by sweet or buttermilk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Aunt Jenny’s Johnny Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Mix as above; knead well, and bake upon a perfectly
clean and sweet board, before a hot fire, with something
at the back to keep it up. Incline at such an angle as
will prevent the cake from slipping off, until it is hardened
slightly by baking, then place upright. Baste
frequently with butter until nicely crisped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Batter Bread, or “Egg Bread.”</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Half a cup cold boiled rice.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>2 cups Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful lard or butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 pint milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the eggs light, and the rice to a smooth batter
in the milk. Melt the shortening. Stir all together
very hard, and bake in shallow tins very quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Risen Corn Bread.</span></h3>

<p>Mix a tolerably stiff dough of corn-meal and boiling
water, a little salt, and a tablespoonful butter. Let it
stand four or five hours until light; make into small
loaves and bake rather quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-meal Pone.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>A little lard, melted.</li>
<li>Cold water to make a soft dough.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Mould with the hands into thin oblong cakes, lay in a
well-greased pan, and bake very quickly.</p>

<p>The common way is to mould into oval mounds, higher
in the middle than at the ends, shaping these rapidly and
lightly with the hands, by tossing the dough over and
over. This is done with great dexterity by the Virginia
cooks, and this corn-meal pone forms a part of every
dinner. It is broken, not cut, and eaten very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ash Cake</span></h3>

<p>is mixed as above. A clean spot is swept upon the
hot hearth, the bread put down and covered with hot
wood ashes. It must be washed and wiped dry before it
is eaten. A neater way is to lay a cabbage-leaf above
and below the pone. The bread is thus steamed before it
is baked, and is made ready for eating by stripping off
the leaves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Pone.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of moulding the dough with the hands, cut into
slices with a knife. Try out some fat pork in a frying-pan,
and fry the slices in the gravy thus obtained to a
light-brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Griddle-Cakes, Waffles, etc.</span></h3>

<p>If you have not used your griddle or waffle-iron for
some time, wash it off hard with hot soap and water; wipe
and rub well with dry salt. Heat it and grease with a
bit of fat salt pork on a fork. It is a mistake, besides
being slovenly and wasteful, to put on more grease than
is absolutely necessary to prevent the cake from sticking.
A piece of pork an inch square should last for several
days. Put on a great spoonful of butter for each cake,
and before filling the griddle test it with a single cake, to
be sure that all is right with it as well as the batter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The same rules apply to waffles. Always lay hot cakes
and waffles upon a hot plate as soon as baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buckwheat Cakes.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart buckwheat flour.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls yeast.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 handful Indian meal.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls molasses—<i>not</i> syrup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Warm water enough to make a thin batter. Beat very
well and set to rise in a warm place. If the batter is in
the least sour in the morning, stir in a very little soda
dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Mix in an earthen crock, and leave some in the bottom
each morning—a cupful or so—to serve as sponge
for the next night, instead of getting fresh yeast. In cold
weather this plan can be successfully pursued for a week
or ten days without setting a new supply. Of course you
add the usual quantity of flour, &amp;c., every night, and beat
up well.</p>

<p>Do not make your cakes too small. Buckwheats
should be of generous size. Some put two-thirds buckwheat,
one-third oat-meal, omitting the Indian.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Flannel Cakes.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls yeast.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter, melted.</li>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shortcake, &amp;c.</span></h3>


<h4><i>Sunnybank Shortcake</i> (<i>for fruit.</i>) ✠</h4>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 scant quarts flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>3 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>2½ cups sour or buttermilk. ”Loppered“ cream is still better.</li>
<li>2 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop up the shortening in the salted flour, as for pastry.
Add the eggs and soda to the milk; put all together,
handling as little as may be. Roll lightly and quickly
into two sheets, the one intended for the upper crust half
an inch thick, the lower less than this. Lay the latter
smoothly in a well-greased baking-pan, strew it <i>thickly</i>
with raspberries, blackberries, or, what is better yet,
huckleberries; sprinkle four or five tablespoonfuls of sugar
over these, cover with the thicker crust, and bake from
twenty to twenty-five minutes, until nicely browned, but
not dried. Eat hot for breakfast with butter and powdered
sugar.</p>

<p>If sweet milk be used, add two teaspoonfuls cream-tartar
sifted into the dry flour. It should be mixed as soft as
can be rolled. This shortcake is very nice made with the
common “black-caps” or wild raspberries.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Shortcake.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>1 <i>large</i> cup sour cream or very rich “loppered” milk.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed, in mixing and baking, as with the huckleberry
short-cake, except that, instead of putting the berries between
the crust, you lay one sheet of paste smoothly upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the other, and bake until done. While warm—not hot—separate
these. They will come apart easily, just where
they were joined. Lay upon the lower a thick coating
several deep, of strawberries; sprinkle powdered sugar
among and over them; cover with the upper crust. It
is best to bake strawberry shortcake in round jelly-cake
tins, or round pans a little deeper than these, as they
should be sent to table whole, while the hot short-cake is
generally cut into square slices, and piled upon a plate.</p>

<p>Strawberry shortcake is esteemed a great delicacy in
its season. It is eaten at tea, cut into triangles like pie,
and sweet cream poured over each slice, with more sugar
sifted over it, if desired.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Short-bread.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 lbs. flour.</li>
<li>1 lb. best butter.</li>
<li>½ lb. powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the flour and butter together, having made the
latter quite soft by setting it near the fire. Knead in the
sugar, roll into a sheet half an inch thick, and cut in
shapes with a cake-cutter. Bake upon buttered paper in
a shallow tin until crisp and of a delicate yellowish brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grandma’s Shortcake.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. flour, dried and sifted.</li>

<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of soda, thoroughly dissolved in just enough vinegar to cover it, and well worked in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough ice-water to enable you to roll out into paste
half an inch thick. Cut into squares, prick with a fork,
and bake light brown. Split, butter, and eat while hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Easter Buns</span> (“<i>Hot Cross.</i>”) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 cups sweet milk.</li>
<li>1 cup yeast.</li>
<li>Flour to make thick batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set this as a sponge over night. In the morning add—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup butter, melted.</li>
<li>½ nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flour enough to roll out like biscuit. Knead well, and
set to rise for five hours. Roll half an inch thick, cut
into round cakes, and lay in rows in a buttered baking-pan.
When they have stood half an hour, make a cross
upon each with a knife, and put instantly into the oven.
Bake to a light brown, and brush over with a feather or
soft bit of rag, dipped in the white of an egg beaten up
stiff with white sugar.</p>

<p>These are the “hot cross-buns” of the “London cries.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Buns</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are made as above, but not rolled into a sheet. Knead
them like biscuit-dough, taking care not to get it too stiff,
and after the five-hour rising, work in two or three handfuls
of currants which have been previously well washed
and dredged with flour. Mould with your hands into
round balls, set these closely together in a pan, that they
may form a loaf—“one, yet many”—when baked. Let
them stand nearly an hour, or until very light; then bake
from half to three-quarters of an hour until brown. Wash
them over while hot with the beaten egg and sugar.</p>

<p>These are generally eaten cold, or barely warm, and
are best the day they are baked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Use none but the best materials for making cake. If
you cannot afford to get good flour, dry white sugar, and
the best family butter, make up your mind to go without
your cake, and eat plain bread with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>There are no intermediate degrees of quality in eggs. I
believe I have said that somewhere else, but it ought to
be repeated just here. They should be, like Cæsar’s wife,
above suspicion. A tin whisk or whip is best for beating
them. The “Dover Egg-beater” is the best in the market.
All kinds of cake are better for having the whites and
yolks beaten separately. Beat the former in a large shallow
dish until you can cut through the froth with a knife,
leaving as clear and distinct an incision as you would in a
solid substance. Beat the yolks in an earthenware bowl
until they cease to froth, and thicken as if mixed with
flour. Have the dishes <i>cool</i>—not too cold. It is hard
to whip whites stiff in a warm room.</p>

<p>Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Cakes often fail
because this rule is not followed. Beat these as faithfully
as you do the eggs, warming the butter very slightly if
hard. Use only a silver or wooden spoon in doing this.</p>

<p>Do not use fresh and stale milk in the same cake. It
acts as disastrously as a piece of new cloth in an old
garment. Sour milk makes a spongy cake; sweet, one
closer in grain.</p>

<p>Study the moods and tenses of your oven carefully before
essaying a loaf of cake. Confine your early efforts
to tea-cakes and the like. Jelly-cake, baked in shallow
flat tins, is good practice during the novitiate. Keep the
heat steady, and as good at bottom as top.</p>

<p>Streaks in cake are caused by unskilful mixing, too
rapid or unequal baking, or a sudden decrease in heat before
the cake is quite done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t delude yourself, and maltreat those who are to
eat your cake, by trying to make soda do the whole or
most of the duty of eggs. Others have tried it before,
with unfortunate results. If curiosity tempt you to the
experiment, you had better allay it by buying some
sponge-cake at the corner bakery.</p>

<p>Test whether a cake is done by running a clean straw
into the thickest part. It should come up clean.</p>

<p>Do not leave the oven-door open, or change the cake
from one oven to the other, except in extreme cases. If
it harden too fast on the top, cover with paper. It should
rise to full height before the crust forms.</p>

<p>Except for gingerbread, use none but white sugar.</p>

<p>Always sift the flour.</p>

<p>Be accurate in your weights and measures.</p>

<p><i>There is no royal road to good fortune in cake-making.
What is worth doing at all is worth doing well.</i> There is
no disgrace in not having time to mix and bake a cake.
You may well be ashamed of yourself if you are too lazy,
or careless, or hurried to beat your eggs, cream your butter
and sugar, or measure your ingredients.</p>

<p>Yet, sometimes, when you believe you have left no
means untried to deserve success, failure is your portion.
What then?</p>

<p>If the cake be uneatable, throw it away upon the first
beggar-boy who comes for broken meat, and say nothing
about it. If streaky or burned, cut out the best parts,
make them presentable as possible, and give them to John
and the children as a “second-best” treat. Then keep
up a brave heart and try again. You <i>may</i> not satisfy
yourself in a dozen trials. You certainly <i>will</i> not, if you
never make another attempt.</p>

<p>Cake should be wrapped in a thick cloth as soon as
cool, and kept in tight tin boxes. Do not cut more at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
time than you are likely to use, as it is not good when
dry. Jelly-cakes are best set away upon plates, cloths
wrapped closely about them, and a box enclosing all.</p>

<p>Cream your sugar and butter, measure milk, spices, etc.,
before beginning work. For fruit-cake it is best to prepare
the materials the day before. Let your icing dry
thoroughly before wrapping up the cake.</p>

<p><i>Sift your flour before measuring</i>, as all the following
receipts are for sifted flour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Icing.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Whites of 4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 pound powdered white sugar.</li>
<li>Lemon, vanilla, or other seasoning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the whites into a broad, clean, cool dish. Throw
a small handful of sugar upon them, and begin whipping
it in with slow, steady strokes of the beater. A few
minutes later, throw in more sugar, and keep adding it at
intervals until it is all used up. Beat perseveringly until
the icing is of a smooth, fine, and firm texture. Half an
hour’s beating should be sufficient, if done well. If not
stiff enough, put in more sugar. A little practice will
teach you when your end is gained. If you season with
lemon-juice, allow, in measuring your sugar, for the additional
liquid. Lemon-juice or a very little tartaric acid
whitens the icing. Use <i>at least</i> a quarter of a pound of
sugar for each egg.</p>

<p>This method of making icing was taught me by a confectioner,
as easier and surer than the old plan of beating
the eggs first and alone. I have used no other since my
first trial of it. The frosting hardens in one-fourth the
time required under the former plan, and not more than
half the time is consumed in the manufacture. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
often iced a cake but two hours before it was cut, and
found the sugar dry all through.</p>

<p>Pour the icing by the spoonful on the top of the cake
and near the centre of the surface to be covered. If the
loaf is of such a shape that the liquid will settle of itself
to its place, it is best to let it do so. If you spread it, use
a broad-bladed knife, dipped in cold water. If it is as
thick with sugar as it should be, you need not lay on
more than one coat. You may set it in a moderate oven
for three minutes, if you are in great haste. The better
plan is to dry in a sunny window, where the air can get
at it, and where there is no dust.</p>

<p>Color icing yellow by putting the grated peel of a lemon
or orange in a thin muslin bag, straining a little juice
through it, and squeezing it hard into the egg and sugar.</p>

<p>Strawberry-juice colors a pretty pink, as does also cranberry-syrup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Icing.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Whites of four eggs.</li>
<li>1 pound sweet almonds.</li>
<li>1 pound powdered sugar.</li>
<li>A little rose-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over them
and stripping off the skins. When dry, pound them to a
paste, a few at a time, in a Wedgewood mortar, moistening
it with rose-water as you go on. When beaten fine and
smooth, beat gradually into icing, prepared according to
foregoing receipt.</p>

<p>Put on very thick, and, when nearly dry, cover with
plain icing.</p>

<p>This is very fine.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Mingle a few bitter almonds with the sweet. The blended
flavor of these and the rose-water is very pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady from whom I had this admirable receipt was
celebrated among her acquaintances for her beautiful and
delicious sponge-cake.</p>

<p>“Which should always be baked in tins like these,”
she said to me once, sportively, “or it does not taste just
right.”</p>

<p>The moulds were like a large brick in shape, with almost
perpendicular sides. I instantly gave an order for a
couple precisely like them, and really fancied that cake
baked in them was a little better than in any other form.
But you can hardly fail of success if you prepare yours
precisely as I have directed, bake in whatever shape you
will. Be careful that your oven is steady, and cover the
cake with paper to prevent burning.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to line the pans in which sponge-cake
is baked with buttered paper, fitted neatly to the sides
and bottom.</p>

<li>1 tablespoonful cinnamon.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cloves.</li>
<li>1 wineglass brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar, add the beaten yolks of
the eggs, and stir all <i>well</i> together before putting in half
of the flour. The spice should come next, then the
whipped whites stirred in alternately with the rest of the
flour, lastly the brandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The above quantity is for two large cakes. Bake
at least two hours in deep tins lined with well-buttered
paper.</p>

<p>The icing should be laid on stiff and thickly. This
cake, if kept in a cool, dry place, will not spoil in two
months.</p>

<p>I have eaten wedding-cake a year old.</p>

<p>Test the cakes well, and be sure they are quite done
before taking them from the oven.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Macaroons.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the almonds the day before you make the cakes,
by blanching them in boiling water, stripping off the skins,
and pounding them when <i>perfectly</i> cold—a few at a time—in
a Wedgewood mortar, adding from time to time a little
rose-water. When beaten to a smooth paste, stir in, to a
pound of the sweet almonds, a generous tablespoonful of
essence of bitter almonds; cover closely, and set away in a
cold place until the morrow. Then to a pound of the nuts
allow:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. powdered sugar.</li>
<li>The beaten whites of eight eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful arrowroot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the sugar and white of egg lightly together; then
whip in gradually the almond-paste.</p>

<p>Line a broad baking-pan with buttered white paper;
drop upon this spoonfuls of the mixture at such distances
apart as shall prevent their running together. Sift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
powdered sugar thickly upon each, and bake in a quick
oven to a delicate brown.</p>

<p>Try the mixture first, to make sure it is of the right
consistency, and if the macaroons run into irregular
shapes, beat in more sugar. This will hardly happen,
however, if the mixture is already well beaten.</p>

whipped stiff, and the soda. At the last stir in the
huckleberries with a wooden spoon or paddle, not to bruise
them. Bake in a loaf or card, in a moderate but steady
oven, until a straw comes out clean from the thickest part.</p>

<p>This is for a large quantity of crullers. Roll out in a

one. It should rise almost instantly to the surface. Crullers
and doughnuts soak in fat at the bottom of the kettle.
These should be a fine yellow.</p>

<p>The most delicious and the nicest-looking crullers I
have ever seen were made by the dear old lady from whom
I had this receipt. They were as pretty and perfect a
picture of their kind as she was of hers.</p>

<p>Crullers are better the second day than the first. If
the fat becomes so hot that the crullers brown before they
puff out to their full dimensions, take the kettle from the
fire for a few minutes. Have enough cut out before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>

is quite melted take off the kettle and instantly stir in the
hot almonds. Have ready a tin pan or mould, well
buttered and slightly warmed. Pour in the nougat;
press it thin and flat to the bottom of the pan if you mean
to cut into strips; to all sides of the mould if you intend
to fill it with syllabub or macaroons. Let it cool in the
mould, for the latter purpose, withdrawing it carefully
when you want it. If you cut it up, do it while it is still
warm—not hot.</p>

<p>The syrup should be a bright yellow before putting in
the almonds.</p>

<h2>PIES.</h2>

<p>Use none but the best butter in pastry.</p>

<p>“Cooking butter is a good thing,” said a grave epicure
to me once, “an admirable thing—in its place, which is
in the soap-fat kettle or upon wagon-wheels!”</p>

<p>It is certainly out of place in biscuits, cake, or in any
substance destined for human palates and stomachs. It is
never less in place than in pastry; never betrays its vileness
more surely and odiously.</p>

<p>Butter intended for pastry should be washed carefully
in several clear, cold waters, and kneaded while under
water, to extract the salt. Then wipe it dry and lay it in
a cold place until you are ready to work it in.</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” is a cardinal motto for pastry-makers.
A marble slab is a good thing to roll out paste upon.
Next to this, the best article is a <i>clean</i> board of hard
wood, which is never used for any other purpose. It is
harder to make good pastry in warm weather than cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
on account of the tendency of the butter to oil, and thus
render the crust heavy and solid.</p>

<p>Few people know what really good pastry is. Fewer
still can make it. It has no inevitable resemblance either
to putty or leather. It <i>is</i> light, crisp, flaky, goodly to
behold—goodlier to the taste.</p>

<p>“Pork fat and pies kill more people yearly in the
United States than do liquor and tobacco,” said a popular
lecturer upon conservatism.</p>

<p>Perhaps so; but I incline to the belief that bad pastry
is answerable for a vast majority of the murders. Not
that I recommend pies of any description as healthful
daily food—least of all for children. But since they are
eaten freely all over our land, let us make them as wholesome
and palatable as possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family Pie-Crust</span> (No. 1.) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li>⅓ lb. lard, sweet and firm.</li>
<li>½ lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 small teacup ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift the flour into a deep wooden bowl. With a broad-bladed
knife, or a small keen “chopper,” cut up the lard
into the flour until it is fine as dust. Wet with ice-water
into a stiff dough, working it with a wooden spoon until
obliged to make it into a roll or ball with your hands.
Flour these, and knead the paste into shape with as few
strokes as will effect your end. Lay the lump upon a
floured kneading-board and roll it out into a thin sheet,
always rolling from you with quick, light action. When
thin enough, stick bits of butter in regular close rows all
over the sheet, using a knife for this purpose rather than
your hands. Roll up the paste into close folds as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
would a sheet of music. Flatten it that your rolling-pin
can take hold, and roll out again as thin as before. Baste,
roll up and then out, until your butter is gone. It is a
good plan to sprinkle the inside of each sheet with a little
flour after buttering it, before making it into a roll.
Finally, make out your crust; butter your pie-plates, lay
the paste lightly within them, cut it off evenly about the
edges after fitting it neatly; gather up the scraps left from
cutting, and make into another sheet. If the pies are to
have a top crust, fill the plates with fruit or whatever you
have ready, lay the paste on this, cut it to fit, and press
down the edges to prevent the escape of the juice, with a
spoon, knife, or jagging-iron, ornamenting it in a regular
figure.</p>

<p>Bake in a moderate oven until a light brown. Be
particularly careful to have your heat as great at the
bottom as at the top, or the lower crust will be clammy
and raw.</p>

<p>Pastry is always best when fresh.</p>

<p>It is well, when you can spare the time, to lay the roll,
when all the butter is used up, in a very cold place for
fifteen minutes or so before rolling it into crust. Indeed,
some good housewives let it stand on the ice an hour in
hot weather. They say it tends to make it flaky as well
as firm.</p>

<p>Touch as little with your hands as may be practicable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family Pie-Crust</span> (No. 2.) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. flour.</li>
<li>¾ lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls cream-tartar.</li>
<li>Ice-water to make into a stiff dough.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Chop half the butter into the flour until it looks like
yellow sand (sift the soda and cream-tartar with the flour,
passing it through the sieve twice to make sure it is well
mixed); work with ice-water into stiff dough; roll into a
thin sheet, baste with one-third the remaining butter, fold
up closely into a long roll, flatten and re-roll, then baste
again. Repeat this operation three times, until the butter
is gone, when make out your crust.</p>

<p>This is an easy and sure receipt, and the paste very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Puff Paste.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. flour.</li>
<li>¾ lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 egg; use the yolk only.</li>
<li>Ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop half the butter into the flour; stir the beaten egg
into half a cup ice-water, and work the flour into a stiff
dough; roll out <i>thin</i>, baste with one-third the remaining
butter, fold closely, roll out again, and so on until the
butter is used up. Roll very thin, and set the last folded
roll in a very cold place ten or fifteen minutes before making
out the crust. Wash with beaten egg while hot.
This paste is very nice for oyster-<i>pâtés</i> as well as for fruit-pies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Puff-Paste.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 egg, well beaten. Use the yolk only.</li>
<li>1 gill ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the flour, a tablespoonful of butter, the beaten egg
and ice-water into a paste with a wooden spoon. Flour
your pastry-board, and roll out the crust very thin. Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the rest of the butter, when you have washed it, in the
centre of this sheet, in a flat cake. Turn the four corners
of the paste over it, and roll out carefully, not to break
the paste. Should it give way, flour the spot, that it may
not stick to the roller. When very thin, sprinkle lightly
with flour, fold up, and roll out four times more. Set in
a cool place for an hour, roll out again, and cut into tartlet-shells
or top crust for pies.</p>

<p>The bottom crust of pies may often be made of plainer
pastry than the upper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transparent Crust.</span> (<i>Very rich.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. flour.</li>
<li>1 lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 egg—the yolk only.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the butter, dry, and then melt it in a vessel set
in another of boiling water, stirring gently all the while
to prevent oiling. Take off the salty scum from the top,
and when almost cold beat up the butter little by little
with the egg, which should be previously whipped light.
When these are thoroughly incorporated, work in the
flour, roll out twice, sprinkling lightly with flour before
you fold it up; let it stand folded five minutes in a cold
place, and make out for tartlets or <i>pâtés</i>. It is not suitable
for large pies. Bake before you fill them, and brush
over with a beaten egg while hot.</p>

chopped fine, may be added. Chop the meat, clean out
bits of skin and gristle, and mix with twice the quantity
of fine juicy apples, also chopped; then put in the fruit,
next the sugar and spice, lastly the liquor. Mix very
thoroughly, cover closely, and let all stand together for
twenty-four hours before making the pies.</p>

</ul>

<p>Mince-meat made by this receipt will keep all winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
in a cool place. Keep in stone jars, tied over with double
covers. Add a little more liquor (if it should dry out),
when you make up a batch of pies. Let the mixture
stand at least twenty-four hours after it is made before it
is used.</p>

<p>Lay strips of pastry, notched with a jagging-iron, in a
cross-bar pattern, upon the pie, instead of a top-crust.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of warning the innocent reader
against placing any confidence whatever in dried currants.
I years ago gave over trying to guess who put the dirt in
them. It is always there! Gravel-stones lurking under a
specious coating of curranty-looking paste, to crucify
grown people’s nerves and children’s teeth; mould that
changes to mud in the mouth; twigs that prick the
throat, not to mention the legs, wings, and bodies of tropical
insects—a curious study to one interested in the entomology
of Zante. It is all <i>dirt!</i> although sold to us at
<i>currant</i> prices.</p>

<p>Wash your currants, therefore, first in warm water,
rolling up your sleeves, and rubbing the conglomerate
masses apart, as you would scrub a muddy garment.
Drain them in a cullender, and pass them through three
more waters—cold now, but cleansing. Then spread them
upon a large dish, and enter seriously upon your geological
and entomological researches. “Sultanas”—sweet and
seedless—are nearly as troublesome, but their specialty is
more harmless, being stickiness and stems.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since John has a weakness for mince-pies
(I never saw an un-dyspeptic man who had not), it is
worth your while to make them, having this consolation,
that if you are wise you need not engage in the manufacture
oftener than once, or at most, twice a winter. But
let the children taste them sparingly, and never at night,
if you value their health and your own sound slumbers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mince-pie in summer is a pleasant rarity,” was the
remark of a party of hungry travellers, in semi-apology
for the fact that every plate made a return journey to the
comely landlady, who was dispensing generous triangles of
pie. She smiled gratifiedly, but said nothing in reply,
until, when the gentlemen had strolled off to the woods
with their cigars, she came upon me, seated alone on the
piazza, and grew confidential under the influence of that
sort of free-masonic understanding housekeepers have
with one another, almost at sight.</p>

<p>“I had to laugh,” said the good soul, “when they
praised my mince-pies. They’re healthfuller in summer
time than the real thing.”</p>

<p>I took down the receipt on the spot from her lips. If
any one doubts the merits of the counterfeit, let her do as
I did—try it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pie</span> (<i>No. 1.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice ripe, tart winter apples—Pippins,
Greenings, or Baldwins—line your dish with a good crust,
put in a layer of fruit, then sprinkle light-brown sugar
thickly over it, scatter half a dozen whole cloves upon
this, lay on more apples, and so on, until the dish is well
filled. Cover with crust and bake. Sift powdered sugar
over the top before sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pie</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and
cored them. Mash to a smooth compote, sweeten to taste,

Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your crust, and
either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or bake without
cover.</p>

with the apple, and remove when cold. Fill your crust,
and bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick
méringue, made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of
three eggs for each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of
powdered sugar for each egg. Flavor this with rose-water
or vanilla; beat until it will stand alone, and cover the
pie three-quarters of an inch thick. Set back in the oven
until the méringue is well “set.” Should it color too
darkly, sift powdered sugar over it when cold. Eat cold.</p>

<li>1 lemon, chop the inside very fine and grate the rind.</li>
<li>1 cup sugar.</li>

with three tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and a
little rose-water. When the pies are done, take from the
oven just long enough to spread the méringue over the
top, and set back for three minutes. This mixture is
enough for two small, or one good-sized pie.</p>

<p>Eat cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Tarts.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks.</li>
<li>½ cake of Baker’s chocolate, grated.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful corn-starch dissolved in water.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful butter, melted.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Rub the chocolate smooth in the milk and heat to boiling
over the fire, then stir in the corn-starch. Stir five
minutes until well thickened, remove from the fire, and
pour into a bowl. Beat all the yolks and the whites of
two eggs well with the sugar, and when the chocolate
mixture is almost cold, put all together with the flavoring,
and stir until light. Bake in open shells of pastry.
When done, cover with a méringue made of the whites of
two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with a
teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Eat cold.</p>

<p>These are nice for tea, baked in pattypans.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa-nut Pie</span> (No. 1.) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ lb. grated cocoa-nut.</li>
<li>¾ lb. white sugar (powdered.)</li>
<li>6 oz. butter.</li>
<li>5 eggs—the whites only.</li>
<li>1 glass white wine.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls rose-water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar, and when well mixed, beat
very light, with the wine and rose-water. Add the cocoanut
with as little and as light beating as possible; finally,
whip in the stiffened whites of the eggs with a few skillful
strokes, and bake at once in open shells. Eat cold, with
powdered sugar sifted over them.</p>

<p>These are very pretty and delightful pies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa-nut Pie</span> (No. 2.)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. grated cocoa-nut.</li>
<li>½ lb. butter.</li>
<li>½ lb. powdered sugar.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>1 glass of brandy.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls lemon-juice.</li>
<li>4 eggs—white and yolks separated.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar together; beat light with the
brandy and lemon-juice; stir in the beaten yolks; lastly
the cocoa-nut and the whites, alternately. Bake in open
shells.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa-nut Custard Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. cocoa-nut, grated.</li>
<li>½ lb. powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 quart milk, <i>unskimmed</i>.</li>
<li>6 eggs beaten to a froth.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla or rose-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the milk, take it from the fire, and whip in gradually
the beaten eggs. When nearly cold, season; add
the cocoa-nut, and pour into paste-shells. Do not boil the
egg and milk together. Bake twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Some put the custard quite raw into the pie-dishes, but
the cocoa-nut is apt, in that case, to settle at the bottom.</p>

<p>You may, however, pour the raw mixture into cups,
and bake by setting in a pan of boiling water, stirring
well once, as they begin to warm. This is cocoa-nut cup-custard,
and is much liked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Custard-Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quarter-cake of Baker’s chocolate, grated.</li>
<li>1 pint boiling water.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>½ cup white sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Dissolve the chocolate in a very little milk, stir into
the boiling water, and boil three minutes. When nearly
cold, beat up with this the yolks of all the eggs and the
whites of three. Stir this mixture into the milk, season,
and pour into shells of good paste. When the custard is
“set”—but not more than half done—spread over it the
whites, whipped to a froth, with two tablespoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>You may bake these custards without paste, in a pudding-dish
or cups set in boiling water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-starch Custard Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>3 pints milk.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls corn-starch.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls essence bitter almonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the milk, stir in the corn-starch wet in a little cold
milk, and boil one minute. When nearly cold, stir in the
sugar, the yolks of all the eggs, and the whites of two;
flavor, and pour into your paste-shells. Whip the remaining
whites to a méringue, with two tablespoonfuls white
sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla, and when the custard
is just “set,” draw your pies to the edge of the oven to
spread this over them. Do it quickly, lest the custard fall
by exposure to the air.</p>

<p>You may bake this as a pudding by omitting the pastry.
Eat cold.</p>

<p>If you have not corn-starch, substitute arrow-root or
rice-flour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Custard Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>Flavor with vanilla or other essence.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>Beat the yolks and sugar light, and mix with the milk;
flavor, whip in the whites, which should be already a stiff
froth, mix well, and pour into shells. Grate nutmeg
upon the top.</p>

<p>Bake this as cup-custard, or a custard pudding, in cups
or a deep dish set in a pan of boiling water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Pie.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Peel, stone, and slice the peaches. Line a pie-plate
with a good crust, and lay in your fruit, sprinkling sugar
liberally over them in proportion to their sweetness. Very
ripe peaches require comparatively little. Allow three
peach-kernels, chopped fine, to each pie; pour in a very
little water, and bake with an upper crust, or with cross-bars
of paste across the top.</p>

<p>Some simply pare the peaches and put in whole, packing
them well, and sweetening freely. In this case they
should be covered entirely with crust.</p>

<p>For one of the most delightful pies that can be made of
any fruit, look for <i>apple méringue pie</i>, and substitute
peaches. Peach méringue pie may be made in winter
from canned peaches.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line the dish with a good crust, and fill with ripe cherries,
regulating the quantity of sugar you scatter over
them by their sweetness. Cover and bake.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackberry, Raspberry, and Plum Pies</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are made in the same manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant and Raspberry Tart.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>To three cups of currants allow one of raspberries. Mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
well together before you fill the crust, and sweeten abundantly.
Cover with crust and bake.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant Tart</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made as above, with more sugar. The most common
fault of currant pie is extreme sourness. Small fruits
should be looked over carefully before they are cooked.
Currants are troublesome, but they must nevertheless be
looked after warily on account of their extreme stemminess.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Gooseberry Tart.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Top and tail the gooseberries. Put into a porcelain
kettle with enough water to prevent burning, and stew
slowly until they break. Take them off, sweeten <i>well</i>,
and set aside to cool. When cold pour into pastry shells,
and bake with a top crust of puff-paste. Brush all over
with beaten egg while hot, set back in the oven to glaze
for three minutes.</p>

<p>Eat cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ripe Gooseberry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Top and tail the berries. Line your dish with crust,
and fill with berries, strewing white sugar among them.
Cover and bake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Damson Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over the fruit, put in a dish lined with pastry,
sweeten very freely, cover and bake. Brush with beaten
egg when done, and return to the oven for a few minutes
to glaze.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pick over the berries. Put into a porcelain
saucepan with a very little water, and simmer until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
burst open and become soft. Run through a cullender to
remove the skins, and sweeten to taste. Bake in pastry
shells, with a cross-bar of pastry over the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cap and pick over the berries, arrange in layers, besprinkle
with a good coating of sugar, in a shell of pastry.
Fill it very full, as strawberries shrink very much in
cooking. Cover with crust and bake.</p>

<p>Huckleberry pie is made in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Raspberry Tart.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Line a dish with paste and fill with raspberries, made
very sweet with powdered sugar. Cover with paste, but
do not pinch it down at the edges. When done, lift the
top crust, which should be thicker than usual, and pour
upon the fruit the following mixture:—</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 small cup of milk—half cream, if you can get it, heated to boiling.</li>
<li>Whites of two eggs, beaten light and stirred into the boiling milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful corn-starch wet in cold milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil these ingredients three minutes; let them get perfectly
cold before you put them into the tart. Replace
the top crust, and set the pie aside to cool. Sprinkle
sugar over the top before serving.</p>

<p>You can make strawberry cream tart in the same
manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rhubarb Tart.</span> (<i>Open.</i>)</h3>

<p>Skin the stalks with care, cut into small pieces; put
into a saucepan with very little water, and stew slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
until soft. Sweeten while hot, but do not cook the sugar
with the fruit. It injures the flavor, by making it taste
like preserves. Have ready some freshly-baked shells.
Fill up with the fruit and they are ready to serve.</p>


<h3><i>Or—</i> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may, after sweetening the stewed rhubarb, stir in a
lump of butter the size of a hickory-nut for each pie, also
a well-beaten egg for each, and bake in pastry. Lay
cross-bars of pastry over the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rhubarb Pie</span> (<i>Covered.</i>)</h3>

<p>Skin the stalks, cut in lengths of half an inch; strew
lavishly with sugar, and fill the crusts with the raw fruit.
Some scatter seedless raisins among the rhubarb. Cover,
and bake nearly three-quarters of an hour. Brush with
egg while hot, and return to the oven to glaze.</p>

<p>Eat cold, as you do all fruit-pies.</p>

<h2>SERVANTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago—more than I care to count over—I
read a lively little book entitled, “The Greatest Plague of
Life.” I have forgotten who wrote it, if I ever knew. It
was in the form of an autobiography; the heroine called
herself, with an amusing affectation of disguise, Mrs.
S-k-n-s-t-n,“ and it was illustrated by George Cruikshank.
I read it aloud in my home-circle, and many a hearty
laugh we had over the poor lady’s perplexities and calamities.</p>

<p>Regarding the history as a clever burlesque, I suffered
no appreciable draught upon my sympathies until time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and experience brought me in contact with so many who
echoed her plaint, that I could not but recur, now and then,
with a half-sad smile, to her sufferings under the rule of
Norah, who chased her up-stairs with a carving-knife; with
Mary, who drank up the cherry-brandy, filled the bottle
with cold weak tea, and kept her pitying employers up
all night to pull her through an epileptic fit; with John,
who never answered the parlor bell “unless they persewered;”
whose stomach could not bear cold meat at dinner,
but rallied bravely under a couple of pounds at
supper. There was one nursery-maid who whipped Mrs.
S-k-n-s-t-n’s child, and another who upset the perambulator
in the park, and, too much absorbed in the suit of a
whiskered Guardsman to note what had happened, went
on dragging the carriage upon its side until the baby’s
cheek was cruelly scarified by the gravel—besides a host
of other <i>un</i>worthies set for the distress of Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n’s
mind, body, and estate.</p>

<p>“Douglas Jerrold wrote that book,” interrupts a friend
at my elbow. “And, <i>apropos de bottes</i>, have you seen
Punch’s recent article, ‘Servantgalism; or, What Shall
Be Done With the Missusses?’”</p>

<p>“The malady in America must bear another name,”
remarks a lady, gayly. “We have no servants—at least
in this region. My cook is forty-seven years old, and my
chambermaid a widow, who has buried two children; yet
they would be highly affronted were I to speak of them
except as ‘girls.’ It is a generic term that belongs to the
class ‘who live out,’ from sixteen up to sixty. I had a
lesson on this head not a month since. My laundress,
who has lived with me six years, was thanking me for a
service I had done her brother.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll never forget you for it, mem,’ she sobbed. ‘I’ll
bless you for it, on me knees, night and morning.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad I have been able to help your friends,
Katy,” I said. “You have been a faithful servant to
me——”</p>

<p>She cut my sentence in the middle by walking out of
the room—I supposed, to conceal her emotions. I was
undeceived, five minutes later, when her angry tones
reached me from the kitchen, the door of which she had
left open.</p>

<p>“I’ll never believe a person has a good heart, or
deserves to be called a Christian, who names an honest,
respectable girl, who tries to do her duty, a <i>servant!</i> ‘A
faithful servant!’ says she; ‘as if she was a queen, and
meself a beggar!’”</p>

<p>“What did you say to the ungrateful wretch?” asks a
listener, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I went quietly out of hearing, reminded,
for the hundredth time, of Solomon’s warning, ‘Take no
heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy
servant curse thee.’ I recalled, too, the saying of a
mightier than the Royal Preacher: ‘Whosoever will be
greatest among you, let him be your <i>servant</i>.’”</p>

<p>“I thought you were one of the favored few who had
no trouble with them,” says another housekeeper, sighingly.
“There is real comfort,—excuse me, my dear
Mrs. Sterling—but it is refreshing to a wearied soul to
know that you have felt some of our tribulations. It
seems to me, at times, that there is no other affliction
worthy the name when compared with what we endure
from the ‘Necessary Evil.’ I have tried all sorts—the
representatives from every nation under heaven, I verily
believe—and <i>they are all alike</i>! They will wear me into
an untimely grave yet.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let them, my dear Martha,” replies Mrs.
Sterling, with her sunny smile. “If evils, they are surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
minor afflictions. And, after all, I imagine ‘they’ are a
good deal like the rest of man and womankind—pretty
much as you choose to take them. The truth is, there is
no justice in wholesale denunciation of any class. You
recollect the Western orator’s truism, ‘Human nature,
Mr. President, nine cases out of ten, is human nature.’
When I consider the influences under which a majority of
our servants have been reared—ignorance, poverty, superstition,
often evil example in their homes—my wonder is,
not at the worthlessness of some, but that so many are
virtuous, honest, and orderly. You will allow that, as a
general thing, they are quite as industrious as their mistresses,
and control their tempers almost as well. And we
make so many mistakes in our dealings with them!”</p>

<p>My old friend does not often lecture, but she has something
to say now, and forgets herself in her subject.</p>

<p>“We err so grievously in our management, that a sense
of our failures should teach us charity. Do we understand,
ourselves, what is the proper place of a hired ‘help’ in
our families? If it is the disposition of Mrs. Shoddy to
trample upon them as soulless machines, Mrs. Kindly
makes a sort of elder daughter of her maid; indulges,
consults, and confides in her, and wonders, by-and-by, to
find herself under Abigail’s thumb—her husband and
children subject to the caprices of a pampered menial. I
never hear a lady say of a valued domestic, ‘I could not
get along without her,’ without anticipating as a certainty
the hour when she shall announce, ‘There <i>is</i> such a thing
as keeping a servant too long.’ The crisis comes, then, to
Mrs. Kindly. In a moment of desperation she frees her
neck from the yoke. Abigail packs her six trunks, having
entered Mrs. Kindly’s service, seven years before, with her
worldly all done up in a newspaper, shakes the dust off
the neat Balmoral boots which have replaced her brogans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
against the heartless tyrant who sits crying, in her own
room up-stairs, over thoughts of how Abigail has been so
clean, quick, and devoted to her interests; how she has
nursed her through a long and dangerous illness, and had
the charge of Emma and Bobby from their birth. She
has prepared a handsome present for her in memory of all
this, and is hurt more than by anything else when she
learns that the girl has taken her final departure without
even kissing the baby.</p>

<p>“It is not strange that the deceived mistress should,
from that day, write down Abigail a monster of ingratitude,
and forget the faithful service of years in the smart
of wounded feeling; when the truth is that she did the
maid more injury by injudicious petting, than the latter
could do her mistress had she absconded with all the
plate in the house. She has, as might have been expected,
proved Abigail’s unfitness to be her confidante and co-adviser;
but, at the same time, she has filled her brain
with notions of her superiority to her fellow-servants, her
heart with burnings for the higher station she can never
occupy.</p>

<p>“I speak feelingly upon this subject,” continues Mrs.
Sterling, with a laugh; “for I was once led into this very
mistake myself, by the attractive qualities of a young
woman who lived with me nine years as seamstress and
chambermaid. She was so even-tempered, so sensible, industrious,
and respectful, that she gained upon the esteem
of us all. One day, while we sat together at work, I told
her of some family changes in prospect, prefacing the
communication by the remark, ‘I want to speak to you of
something, Eliza, which you must not mention to any one
else at present. The interests of an employer and a servant
should be the same.’</p>

<p>“Then, very foolishly, I opened up my mind freely on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the subject that engaged it. She answered modestly, but
intelligently, entering into my plans with such cordial interest
and pledges of co-operation, that I went to prepare
for a walk, feeling really strengthened and cheered by the
talk. At the front door I was met by a letter requiring
an immediate reply. Returning to my chamber to lay off
my hat and shawl, I heard Eliza talking loudly and gleefully
in the adjoining sewing-room, with the cook, whom
she must have called up-stairs through the speaking-tube.
You cannot imagine, nor I describe, my sensations at
listening, against my will, to an exaggerated account of
the interview which had just taken place. Not only my
language, but my tones were mimicked with great gusto
and much laughter by my late confidante—the phrase
‘The interests of the employer and the servant should
be the same’ occurring again and again, and forming, apparently,
the cream of the joke. I was very angry. But
for the rule adopted early in my married life, never to
reprove a servant when out of humor, I should instantly
have ordered the treacherous creature—as I named her—from
the house. I sat down instead, to cool off and to
think. With reflection, common sense rallied to my aid.</p>

<p>“‘The girl does well enough in her place, which is that
of a hired chambermaid and seamstress,’ said this monitor.
‘She knew her position, and would have kept it, but for
your folly in dragging her up to temporary equality with
yourself. You made yourself ridiculous, and she was
shrewd enough to see it. Take the lesson to heart; write
it out in full for future guidance, and keep your own
counsel.’</p>

<p>“Eliza never suspected my discovery. She remained
with me until her marriage a year afterward, and we parted
upon good terms.”</p>

<p>I have quoted from my friend at length, because I honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
her excellent judgment and mature experience, and because
I agree so fully with her touching the evil of so-called
confidential servants. The principle of acknowledged
favoritism is ruinous to domestic comfort, let who
may be the object thus distinguished. Rely upon it, my
dear lady, at least one third of home-wrangles and social
scandal arises from this cause. Be assured, also, that if
you do not perceive the impropriety of lowering yourself
to the level of your subordinates, <i>they</i> will, and gauge
their behaviour accordingly. The connection is an unnatural
one, and, like all others of the kind, must terminate
disastrously in time. Then the discarded favorite,
aggrieved and exasperated, leaves your house to tattle in
the ears of some other indiscreet mistress, of your sayings
and doings. Show your servant that you respect yourself
and her too truly to forget what is due to both. Be kind,
pleasant, always reasonable and attentive to her needs,
willing to hearken to and meet any lawful request. Make
her comfortable, and, so far as you can, happy.</p>

<p>Excuse one more quotation from Mrs. Sterling, whom,
when I was much younger than I am now, I consulted
with regard to the just medium between familiarity and
austerity.</p>

<p>“Remember they are human beings, and treat them as
such,” she said. “Not that you are likely to reap a large
reward in their gratitude, but because it is right, and because
you find no exceptions to the practice of the Golden
Rule laid down in the Bible. Be faithful in your obedience
to the law of kindness. With the return tide you
have nothing to do. This is a safe and straight path. I
believe it to be also the smoothest. You will be better
and more cheerfully served than your neighbor, who, recognizing
in every hireling a natural enemy, is always on
the defensive.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>I have found the most serious obstacle to a comfortable
pursuance of her safe path, to lie in this same prejudice—rooted
by centuries of misunderstandings and caste-wars—the
belief of necessary antagonism between employers
and employed. Mrs. Sterling’s Eliza only expressed the
prevailing sentiment of her class, when she ridiculed her
mistress’ proposition that their interests ought to be identical.
I have failed so often and so signally in the endeavor
to impress the merits of this policy upon domestics,
that I rarely attempt it now. There is always a suspicion—more
or less apparent—that you have a single eye to
self-interest in all your regulations and counsels. “What
does she hope to gain? What am I in danger of losing?”
are the queries that invariably present themselves to the
subordinate’s mind. The arguments by which your
plans are supported are thrown away upon ignorant and
illogical listeners—your array of facts totally disbelieved.
Your auditor does not say this, but in divers and ingenious
ways she contrives to let you know that she is not
so silly as to be imposed upon by the specious array of
evidence.</p>

<p>For how much of this are mistresses responsible? Has
this creed of distrust been learned by experience of injustice
or exaction, or is it one of the popular prejudices,
which are harder to overthrow than sound and well-established
principle? Of one thing I am certain: Mistresses
and maids would more speedily come to a right understanding
of oneness of interest but for the influence exerted
over the former by Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Robinson, and
Mrs. Brown, who don’t allow this, and couldn’t think of
that, and never heard of the other privilege or immunity
being granted to servants. Before they would yield such
a point, or submit to one syllable of dictation, they would
do all their own work, etc., etc. Poor Mrs. Pliable, listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
dumbly and meekly, goes home with a low-spirited
sense of her own pusillanimity upon her, and tries to
assert her authority and redeem past faults by a sudden
tightening of the reins, that results in a runaway and
general smash-up.</p>

<p>Cannot we remember—you and I, my dear reader—that
we may sometimes be as nearly right as those who talk
more loudly and strongly than we upon domestic economy,
laying down rules we never thought of suggesting; splitting
into ninths a hair our short-sighted eyes cannot make
out when whole, and annihilating our timid objections
with a lordly “<i>I</i> always do so,” which is equal to a decree
of infallibility? Cannot we make up our minds, once and
for all, to be a law unto ourselves in all matters pertaining
to our households? Mrs. Jones’ rule may be good for her;
Mrs. Robinson’s better than any other in her particular
case, and Mrs. Brown’s best of all for one in her peculiar
circumstances; yet any one or all of them be unsuitable
for our use.</p>

<p>Avoid talking about your domestic affairs with people
whose gossip on these topics is incessant. You are angry
when a whiff of some such discussion as enlightened Mrs.
Sterling, with regard to her mistake, is wafted to you
through the dumb-waiter or register, an accident that will
occur while the tones of the plaintiffs are loud and untrained
by education or policy. It is mean and unkind—traitorous,
in fact, you say, for them so to misrepresent
and revile you—after all the kindness you have showed
to them, too! Bridget, Chloe, or Gretchen, passing the
parlor-door and catching the sound of her name as
roughly handled, may have her own sensations, and draw
her own inferences—<i>being human like yourself</i>. It is tiresome
and vulgar, this everlasting exchange of experiences
about “my girl,” and “your girl,” and everybody else’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
“girl.” It is time sensible women ceased, in this respect,
to imitate the fashion of the class they censure, and put
down the bootless tattle with a strong will. Order your
household, then, so far aright as you can by the help of
common sense and grace from on high, and let Mesdames
Jones, Robinson, and Brown look to the ways of their
own, and expend their surplus energies upon their neighbors’
concerns—counting you out.</p>

<p>(I believe that is slang, but let it stand!)</p>

<p>These worthy and fussy housewives act upon the supposition
that all “girls” are cast in the same mould. Being
human (do not let us forget that!), the probability is,
that there are varieties of the species.</p>

<p>But, if the mistresses are led by their associates, the
“girl’s” “acquaintances” sway her yet more powerfully.
Every conscientious, well-meaning housewife knows what
a brake is this informal, but terrible “Union” upon her
endeavors to improve and really benefit those under her
direction. I have been amazed and disgusted at the tyranny
exercised by this irresponsible body over the best
servants I have ever seen.</p>

<p>“We would be hooted at, ma’am, if we didn’t give in
to them,” said one, when I represented how senseless and
almost suicidal was the course recommended by these evil
advisers. “There’s not a girl in the town would speak to
us if we didn’t join in with the rest. It’s like a strike,
you see—awful upon them as holds back.”</p>

<p>Do not, then, my discouraged fellow-laborer, imagine
that I am ignorant of your trials, your doubts, your disheartening
experiences. If I disagree with Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n
and do not pronounce our servants to be the greatest
plague of life, inclining rather to the belief that—always
allowing for human nature and the drawbacks I have
enumerated—good mistresses are apt to make good servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
it is in consequence of long and careful study and
observation of the practical working of Mrs. Sterling’s
rule. Like begets like. Pleasant words are more likely
to be answered by pleasant than are tart or hasty ones.
If you would have your servants respectful to you, be respectful
to them. The best way to teach them politeness
is by example. It should not cost you an effort to say,
“Thank you,” or “If you please.” The habit exerts an
unconscious refining influence upon them, and you dignify
instead of degrading your ladyhood by being pitiful and
courteous to all. If you can only maintain your position
by haughtiness and chilling disregard of the feelings of
inferiors, your rank is false, or you unfit to hold it.</p>

<p>To begin, then: Be mistress of yourself. Amid all
your temptations to angry or sarcastic speech (and how
many and how strong these are, you and I know), curb
yourself with the recollection that it is despicable, no less
than useless, to say cutting things to one who has no right
to retort upon you in kind.</p>

<p>“Ma’,” says Miss Aurelia in Miss Sedgwick’s admirable
story, “Live and let Live”—“how can you let your help
be so saucy to you?”</p>

<p>Master Julius, who was standing by, took a different
view of the matter.</p>

<p>“If Ma’ doesn’t want her help to be <i>sarcy</i> to her,” he
said, “she hadn’t ought to be <i>sarcy</i> to them.”</p>

<p>Teach your children the like forms of kindly speech
and habits of consideration for the comfort and happiness
of your domestics, checking with equal promptness undue
freedom and the arrogance of station. It is as graceful
to bend as it is mean to grovel.</p>

<p>Learn not to see everything, and, so soon as you can,
put far from you the delusive hope that anybody else—unless
it be dear old John—will ever serve you as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
you would serve yourself. This failure is attributable to
some one of the nine-tenths we spoke of just now. She is
a prudent housekeeper who can wink at trifling blemishes
without effort or parade. There is one text which has
come into my troubled mind hundreds of times on such
occasions, calming perturbation into solemnity, and bringing,
I hope, charity with humility—</p>

<p>“If <i>Thou</i>, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who
shall stand?”</p>

<p>But if your hold of the rein be gentle, let it also be firm.
Never forget that the house is yours, and that you—not
hirelings—are responsible for the disposition of the stores
purchased with John’s money.</p>

<p>“I was much amused the other day,” said an easy-tempered
lady to me, “at a talk that passed under my window
between my new cook and one of her visitors.</p>

<p>“‘And how are ye gitting along?’ asked the guest.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! pretty well-ish, now,’ was the reply. ‘I was
a-feard, when I first come, that <i>she</i> would bother me a-trotting
down into the kitchen so constant. But I give
her a hint as how that wasn’t the trick of a raal lady,
and she’s kep’ out nicely sence then. You’ve got to stand
up for your own rights in this wurrld, or you’ll be trod
upon.’”</p>

<p>Now, it would be throwing away words to reason with
a woman like that cook, or a mistress might show that in
no other department of labor would such a principle be
tolerated—that from the Secretary of State down to the
scavenger who empties your ash-pan, every employé who
draws wages has an overlooker, to whom he is accountable
for the manner in which his work is done and his
money earned; and that the fact that she is an ignorant,
high-tempered woman is no just cause of exemption. Yet
in how many families is this point tacitly yielded, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
mistress admitted upon sufferance to her own kitchen—the
room furnished with her money, and in which she hardly
dare touch or look at the articles intended for the consumption
of her own family?</p>

<p>One often hears such remarks as, “It isn’t every girl
who will stand having the mistress popping in and out
while she is at work.” When, in any other situation, the
very fact of this unwillingness to have the owner of the
materials used in that work present, would be strong presumptive
proof of negligence or dishonesty. The principle
is pernicious from beginning to end, and should not be
tolerated for an instant.</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure to state here, that I know nothing
personally of this curious reversal of the rights of employer
and domestic. I am inclined to believe, if one-half
I hear of other housewives’ trials be true, that I have
been highly favored among American women. My authority
in the kitchen, as in other parts of the household,
has never been disputed—in my hearing or presence, that
is. I have always met with a cheerful reception below-stairs
when I appeared there to direct or share the labors
of my cooks; have found them willing to undertake new
dishes, and ready to learn my “way,” however unlike it
might be to their own. As a rule, also,—to which the
exceptions have been few and very far between—those
employed by me have been cleanly, industrious, kind-hearted,
and respectful; patient under inconveniences, and
attentive in sickness. I should not, therefore, do my
duty, did I not lift my voice in a plea for charitable
judgment, just and generous treatment of a class which,
however faulty, have much to do and to endure. Mrs.
Skinflint’s grocer’s account may be less than yours, if you
adopt this policy—Mrs. Sharp’s coal-cellar be better
dusted, and the paint in her attic scrubbed oftener; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
believe, in the long run, you will be the most comfortable
in body, as in conscience. Your machinery will move with
fewer jerks and less friction. Your servants will remain
with you longer, and be better-tempered while they stay,
if you show that you appreciate the fact of a common
humanity; that you owe them duties you are resolved to
fulfil during their sojourn under your roof, however mercenary
may be their performance of those devolving upon
them.</p>

<p>Finally, dear sister, do not add to the real miseries of
life by regarding the annoyance of a careless, slothful, or
impertinent domestic as a real trouble. Class it with
petty vexations which are yet curable as well as endurable,
and live above it—a noble, beneficent existence in
the love of your fellow-creatures and the fear of <span class="smcap">God</span>—a
life that can not suffer perceptible disturbance from such
a contemptible rootlet of bitterness as this. It is only the
feeble, the inefficient, or the indolent mistress whose peace
of mind is dependent upon such casualties as a breeze, a
hurricane, or a sudden vacancy in the department of the
interior.</p>

<p>Recollect, when the infliction is sharpest, that brier-pricks
are disagreeable, but never serious, unless the blood
be <i>very</i> impure.</p>

<h2>PUDDINGS.</h2>


<p>I have, for convenience sake, classed among pies all
preparations baked <i>in crust</i> in a pie-dish. Many of these,
however, are called puddings, such as custards of various
kinds, lemon, cocoa-nut, and orange puddings. The reader
will have no trouble in finding the receipts for these, if
she will bear the above remark in mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Puddings.</span></h3>

<p>Beat your eggs very light—and, if you put in only one
or two, whip white and yolk separately, beating the latter
into the sugar before adding the whites.</p>

<p>Fruit, rice, corn-starch, and bread puddings require a
steady, moderate oven in baking. Custard and batter
puddings should be put into the dish, and this into the
oven, the instant they are mixed, and baked quickly. <i>No</i>
pudding, unless it be raised with yeast, should be allowed
to stand out of the oven after the ingredients are put together.
Give one final hard stir just before it goes in,
and be sure the mould is well greased.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Méringue Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint stewed apples.</li>
<li>3 eggs—whites and yolks separate.</li>
<li>½ cup white sugar, and one teaspoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg and cinnamon mixed.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence bitter almond (for the méringue.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sweeten and spice, and, while the apple is still very hot,
stir in the butter, and, a little at a time, the yolks. Beat
all light, pour into a buttered dish, and bake ten minutes.
Cover, without drawing from the oven, with a méringue
made of the beaten whites, two tablespoonfuls white sugar,
and the bitter almond seasoning. Spread smoothly and
quickly, close the oven again, and brown very slightly.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over the top, and send
around cream to pour over it instead of sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apple Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 large firm pippins (grated.)</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>3 tablespoonfuls butter.</li>
<li>½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>4 eggs—whites and yolks separate.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon, and half the peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat butter and sugar to a cream, stir in the yolks, the
lemon, the grated apple, lastly the whites. Grate nutmeg
over the top, and bake until nicely browned.</p>

<p>Eat cold with cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Apple Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>3 cups chopped apple.</li>
<li>1 lemon—all the juice and half the rind.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and cinnamon.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little vinegar.</li>
<li>Flour for a stiff batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks very light, add the milk, seasoning, and
flour. Stir hard five minutes, and beat in the apple, then
the whites, lastly the soda, well mixed in.</p>

<p>Bake in two square shallow pans one hour, and eat hot,
with sweet sauce. Much of the success of this pudding
depends upon the mixing—almost as much upon the baking.
Cover with paper when half done, to prevent hardening.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pippin Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>8 fine pippins, pared, cored, and sliced, breaking them as little as possible.</li>
<li>½ cup very fine bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls butter—melted.</li>
<li>5 eggs—whites and yolks separate.</li>
<li>¾ cup sugar.</li>
<li>1 oz. citron, shred finely.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg, and a dozen whole cloves.</li>
<li>1 cup milk or cream.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk, cream the butter
and sugar, and beat into this the yolks. Next, adding
the milk and soaked bread, stir until very smooth and
light. Put in the nutmeg and citron, and whip in the
whites lightly. Butter a deep dish, and put in your sliced
apple, sprinkling each piece well with sugar, and scattering
the cloves among them. Pour the custard you have
prepared over them, and bake three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Sift powdered sugar over the top, and eat cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Betty.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>2 cups chopped apples—tart.</li>
<li>½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cinnamon.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls butter cut into small bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter a deep dish, and put a layer of the chopped
apple at the bottom; sprinkle with sugar, a few bits of
butter, and cinnamon; cover with bread-crumbs; then
more apple. Proceed in this order until the dish is full,
having a layer of crumbs at top. Cover closely, and
steam three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven; then
uncover and brown quickly.</p>

<p>Eat warm with sugar and cream, or sweet sauce.</p>

<p>This is a homely but very good pudding, especially for
the children’s table. Serve in the dish in which it is
baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Batter Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint rich milk.</li>
<li>2 cups flour.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Peel and core eight apples carefully, and range them
closely together in a deep dish. Beat the batter very
light and pour over them. Unless the apples are very
ripe and sweet (for tart apples), fill the centre of each
with white sugar. Bake an hour, and eat hot with sweet
sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple and Plum Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>¾ lb. fine tart apples, pared and chopped.</li>
<li>¾ lb. sugar.</li>
<li>¾ lb. flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. beef suet, rubbed fine.</li>
<li>¾ lb. raisins, seeded and chopped.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg and the same powdered cloves.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>½ glass brown Sherry and the same of brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the beaten yolks and sugar very light, add the suet
and apples with the spice; then the raisins, well dredged
with flour; next the flour, and when this is all in, the
liquor; lastly the whites beaten <i>very</i> stiff. Bake in two
buttered moulds, in a moderate oven, an hour and a half at
least. Eat hot, with sauce.</p>

<p>You may boil this pudding if you like.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple and Tapioca Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 teacupful tapioca.</li>
<li>6 apples—juicy and well-flavored pippins—pared and cored.</li>
<li>1 quart water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the tapioca with three cups of lukewarm water,
and set it in a tolerably warm place to soak five or six
hours, stirring now and then. Pack your apples in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
deep dish, adding a cup of lukewarm water; cover closely
and steam in a moderate oven until soft all through,
turning them as they cook at bottom. If the dish is more
than a quarter full of liquid, turn some of it out before
you pour the soaked tapioca over all. Unless your apples
are <i>very</i> sweet fill the centre with sugar and stick a
clove in each, just before you cover with the tapioca. Indeed,
I always do this. It softens the hard acid of the
fruit. Bake, after the tapioca goes in, one hour.</p>

<p>Eat warm, with sweet hard sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apple Dumplings.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls lard—or half butter is better.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls cream-tartar sifted into the dry flour.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the shortening into the flour after you have sifted
this and the cream-tartar together; put in the soda and
wet up quickly—just stiff enough to roll into a paste less
than half an inch thick. Cut into squares, and lay in the
centre of each a juicy, tart apple, pared and cored; bring
the corners of the square neatly together and pinch them
slightly. Lay in a buttered baking-pan, the joined edges
downward, and bake to a fine brown. When done, brush
over with beaten egg, and set back in the oven to glaze
for two or three minutes. Sift powdered sugar over them,
and eat hot with rich sweet sauce.</p>

<p>I greatly prefer the above simple crust for all kinds of
dumplings, to the rich paste which becomes heavy so soon
as it begins to cool. It is also more quickly and easily
made, and far more wholesome than pastry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>

</ul>

<p>Soak the tapioca, in enough cold water to cover it, two
hours; drain off the water, if it be not all absorbed; soak
two hours longer in the milk, which should be slightly
warmed. When the tapioca is quite soft, beat the sugar
and butter together; add the yolks, the milk and tapioca,
lastly the whites. Stir very well, and bake in a buttered
dish. Eat warm with sweet sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs—whites and yolks separate.</li>
<li>¾ cup sugar.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the corn-starch in a little cold milk, and having
heated the rest of the milk to boiling, stir this in and
boil three minutes, stirring all the time. Remove from
the fire, and while still very hot, put in the butter. Set
away until cold; beat the eggs very light—the sugar and
seasoning with them, and stir into the corn-starch, beating
thoroughly to a smooth custard. Turn into a buttered
dish, and bake half an hour. Eat cold, with powdered
sugar sifted over it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Méringue.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>¾ cup sugar.</li>
<li>4 teaspoonfuls corn-starch.</li>
<li>½ cup fruit-jelly or jam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling, and stir in the corn-starch,
which has previously been dissolved in a little cold milk.
Boil fifteen minutes, stirring all the while. Remove from
the fire, and while still hot, add gradually the yolks of the
eggs beaten up with the sugar and seasoned with vanilla,
lemon, or bitter almond. Pour this into a buttered pudding-dish
and bake fifteen minutes, or until the custard
begins to “set.” Without withdrawing it further than
the door of the oven, spread lightly and <i>quickly</i> upon this
a méringue of the whites whipped up stiff with a half-cup
jelly—added gradually. Use crab-apple jelly, if bitter
almond has been put into the custard; currant, for vanilla;
strawberry or other sweet conserve, if you season the custard
with lemon. Bake, covered, for five minutes. Then
remove the lid, and brown the méringue <i>very</i> slightly.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted thickly over the
top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrow-root Pudding</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made according to either of the foregoing receipts,

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of fine bread crumbs—<i>always</i> stale and dry.</li>

<li>2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>Nutmeg to taste.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks very light, and having soaked the bread-crumbs
well in the milk, stir these together; then the butter
and seasoning, with the soda; lastly the whites. Bake
to a fine brown, and eat hot with pudding-sauce.</p>

<p>This, if well mixed and baked, is quite a different dish
from the traditional and much-despised bread-pudding
of stingy housekeepers and boarding-house landladies.
“Which,” says an English Josh. Billings, “nothing can
be more promiskus than a boarding-house bread-pudding.”
Try mine instead, putting all the sugar into the sauce,
and enough there, and you will cease to sneer.</p>

<p>You may boil this pudding, if you like, in a floured
cloth or buttered mould.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Bread Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls (heaping) sugar.</li>
<li>¼ lb. raisins, seeded and chopped.</li>
<li>¼ lb. currants, well washed and picked over.</li>
<li>Handful of shred citron, and 1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>2 <i>scant</i> cups fine bread-crumbs, from a stale loaf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks light with the sugar, add the bread-crumbs
when they have been well soaked in the milk, and
stir until smooth. Next put in the fruit, well dredged with
flour, the soda, and finally the whites, whipped to a stiff
froth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>This will require longer and steadier baking than if the
fruit were not in. Cover it if it threatens to harden too
soon on top. Send to table hot in the dish in which it
was baked, or turn out very carefully upon a hot plate.
Eat warm, with pudding-sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-Butter Pudding.</span></h3>

</ul>

<p>Cut thin slices of bread (stale), spread thickly with
butter, and sprinkle with sugar. Fit them neatly and
closely into a buttered pudding-dish until it is half full.
Lay a small, heavy plate upon them to prevent them from
floating, and saturate them gradually with a hot custard
made of the milk, heated almost to boiling, then taken
from the fire, and the beaten eggs and sugar stirred in
with the seasoning. Let the bread soak in this fifteen
minutes or so, adding by degrees all the custard. Just
before you put the pudding in the oven, take up the plate
gently. If the bread still rise to the top, keep down
with a silver fork or spoon, laid upon it from the side of
the dish, until the custard thickens, when slip it out. Eat
cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-marmalade Pudding</span> ✠</h3>

<li>½ cup strawberry or other sweet jam.</li>
<li>½ cup sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter a pudding-dish; sprinkle the bottom with bread-crumbs;
pour over these half a cup jam, and cover this
well with the rest of the crumbs, wet with a very little
milk. Heat the quart of milk until <i>near</i> boiling, take it
from the fire and add, gradually, the beaten yolks and
sugar, stirring in the beaten whites lightly at the last.
Heat this by degrees, stirring constantly until it begins to
thicken; put it, spoonful by spoonful, upon the layer of
bread-crumbs, taking care not to disturb these, and when
all is in, bake until well “set” and very slightly browned.</p>

<p>Eat cold. Cream is a delicious accompaniment to it.</p>

<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Vanilla, rose-water, or lemon seasoning.</li>
<li>1 quart fresh rich milk, and one half cup jelly or jam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter into a cup of sugar; beat the yolks
very light, and stir these together to a cream. The bread-crumbs,
soaked in milk, come next, then the seasoning.
Bake this in a buttered pudding-dish—a large one and
but two-thirds full—until the custard is “set.” Draw to
the mouth of the oven, spread over with jam or other
nice fruit-conserve. Cover this with a méringue made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the whipped whites and half a cup of sugar. Shut the
oven and bake until the méringue begins to color.</p>

this lay some of the raisins—a thick stratum; cover with
crackers—the buttered side downward; moisten with the
custard, and proceed in this order until your crackers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>

melted butter and a glass of pale Sherry.</p>

<p>A plain round mould is best for the pudding, as much
of its comeliness depends upon the manner in which the
cake and macaroons are fitted in.</p>

<p>It is a pretty and good pudding, and will well repay
the trifling trouble and care required to manage it properly.</p>

<p>It is also nice boiled in a buttered mould.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rhubarb Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the stalks as for pies; cover the bottom of a
buttered pudding-dish with slices of bread and butter;
cover with the rhubarb cut into short pieces; sprinkle
abundantly with sugar; then put on another layer of
bread and butter, and so on until your dish is full. Cover
and steam, while baking, for half an hour. Remove the
lid and bake ten minutes, or until browned.</p>

<p>Eat with hot sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gooseberry Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint ripe or nearly ripe gooseberries.</li>
<li>6 or 8 slices toasted stale bread.</li>
<li>1 cup milk.</li>
<li>½ cup sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter, melted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the gooseberries ten minutes—very slowly, not to
break them. Cut your slices of bread to fit your pudding-dish,
and toast to a light brown on both sides. (Cut off
all the crust before toasting.) Dip each slice, while hot,
in milk, and spread with the melted butter. Cover the
bottom of the dish with them; put next a layer of the
gooseberries, sprinkled thickly with sugar; more toast,
more berries, and so on, until the dish is full. Cover
closely and steam in a moderate oven twenty or twenty-five
minutes. Turn out upon a hot dish and pour over it
a good pudding-sauce.</p>

<p>This is considered a wholesome breakfast dish, and is
certainly good. In this case omit the sauce, sift powdered
sugar over the top, and eat with the same.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Belle’s Dumplings.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart <i>prepared</i> flour.</li>
<li>2½ tablespoonfuls lard and butter mixed.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk, or enough to make a soft dough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll out a quarter of an inch thick, cut into oblong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
pieces, rounded at the corners; put a great spoonful damson,
cherry, or other tart preserve in the middle and roll
into a dumpling. Bake three-quarters of an hour, brush
over with beaten egg while hot, set back in the oven three
minutes to glaze.</p>

<p>Eat hot with brandy or wine sauce.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may make a roll-pudding of it by rolling out the paste
into an oblong sheet, spreading thickly with the preserves,
folding it up as one would a travelling-shawl to be put
into a strap, pinching the ends together that the juice may
not escape, and boiling in a floured cloth fitted to the
shape of the “roley-poley.” Boil an hour and a half.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Puddings.</span></h3>

<p>You can boil puddings in a bowl, a mould, or a cloth.
The mould should have a closely-fitting top, and be buttered
well—top and all—before the batter or dough is put
in. These moulds are usually made with hasps or other
fastening. In lack of this, you had better tie down the
cover securely. I once boiled a pudding in a tin pail, the
top of which I made more secure by fitting it over a cloth
floured on the inside, lest the pudding should stick. The
experiment succeeded admirably, and I commend the suggestion
to those who find, after the pudding is mixed, that
their mould leaks, or the bowl that did duty as a substitute
has been broken, and nothing said to “the mistress”
about it. If you use a bowl, butter it, and tie a floured
cloth tightly over the top. If a cloth, have it clean and
sweet, and flour bountifully on the inside. In all, leave
room for batter, bread, rice, and cracker puddings to
swell. Tie the string very tightly about the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
bag, which must be made with <i>felled</i> seams at sides and
bottom, the better to exclude the water.</p>

<p>The water must be boiling when the pudding goes in,
and not stop boiling for one instant until it is done. If it
is in a bag, this must be turned several times, <i>under water</i>,
to prevent sticking or scorching to the sides of the pot.
The bag must also be entirely covered, while the water
should not quite reach to the top of a mould. If you use
a basin, dip the cloth in boiling water before dredging with
flour on the inside.</p>

<p>When the time is up, take mould, basin, or cloth from
the boiling pot, and plunge <i>instantly</i> into cold water; then
turn out without the loss of a second. This will prevent
sticking, and leave a clearer impression of the mould upon
the contents.</p>

<p>Boiled puddings should be served as soon as they are
done, as they soon become heavy.</p>

<p>Many of the baked puddings I have described are quite
as good boiled. As a safe rule, <i>double the time of baking
if you boil</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Berry Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cream-tartar, sifted through a cup of flour, and added to enough flour to make a thick batter.</li>

<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in boiling water.</li>
<li>Nearly a quart of berries—well dredged with flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a batter of eggs, milk, flour, yeast, salt, and soda,
and set it to rise in a warm place about four hours. When
you are ready to boil it, stir in the dredged fruit quickly
and lightly. Boil in a buttered mould or a floured cloth
for two hours.</p>

<p>This will be found lighter and more wholesome than
boiled pastry.</p>

<p>Eat hot with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Valise Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful lard, and same of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonful cream-tartar—sifted through the flour.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
<li>2 cups milk, or enough to make the flour into soft dough.</li>
<li>1 quart berries, chopped apples, sliced peaches, or other fruit; jam, preserves, canned fruit, or marmalade may be substituted for the berries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll out the crust less than half an inch thick—indeed,
a quarter of an inch will do—into an oblong sheet. Cover
thickly with the fruit and sprinkle with sugar. Begin at
one end and roll it up closely, the fruit inside. In putting
this in, leave a narrow margin at the other end of
the roll, which should be folded down closely like the flap
of a pocket-book. Pinch the ends of the folded roll together,
to prevent the escape of the fruit, and baste up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
a bag, the same size and shape as the “valise.” Flour
the bag well before putting in the pudding, having previously
dipped it—the cloth—into hot water, and wring it
out.</p>

<p>Boil an hour and a half. Serve hot with sauce, and
cut crosswise in slices half an inch thick.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Apple Dumplings.</span> (No. 1.) ✠</h3>

<p>Make a paste according to the above receipt; cut in
squares, and put in the centre of each an apple, pared and
cored. Bring the corners together; enclose each dumpling
in a small square cloth, tied up bag-wise, leaving
room to swell. Each cloth should be dipped in hot water,
wrung out and floured on the inside before the apple is
put in.</p>

<p>Boil one hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Dumplings.</span> (No. 2.) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart flour.</li>
<li>¼ lb. suet.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cream-tartar sifted in the flour.</li>
<li>Cold water enough to make into a tolerably stiff paste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll out, cut into squares, put in the middle of each a
fine, juicy apple, pared and cored. Fill the hole left by
the core with marmalade, or with sugar wet with lemon-juice.
Stick a clove in the sugar. Close the paste,
tie up in the cloths, when you have wet them with hot
water and floured them, and boil one hour.</p>

<p>A pleasing idea for dumpling cloths is to crochet them
in a close stitch with stout tidy cotton. They are easily
done, wash and wear well, and leave a very pretty pattern
upon the paste when they are opened. Crochet them
round, with a cord for drawing run into the outer edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Fruit Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare a paste in accordance with either of the foregoing
receipts, but roll into one sheet. Lay apples,
peaches, or berries in the centre, paring and slicing the
fruit; sprinkle with sugar, and close the paste over them
as you would a dumpling. Dip a stout cloth in hot water,
flour the inside, put in the pudding, tie tightly, and boil
two hours and a half.</p>

<p>Eat hot with sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Dumplings.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. rice boiled without stirring, until soft, and at the top dry.</li>
<li>12 pippins, pared and cored.</li>
<li>Strawberry marmalade or crab-apple jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let the rice cool upon a sieve or coarse cloth, that it
may dry at the same time. Dip your dumpling cloths in
hot water; wring them out and flour well inside. Put a
handful of the cold rice upon each, spreading it out into
a smooth sheet. Lay in the centre an apple; fill the hole
left by the core with marmalade or jelly; draw up the
cloth carefully to enclose the apple with a coating of rice;
tie, and boil one hour.</p>

<p>Turn over with care; pour sweet sauce or rich sweetened
cream over them, and send around more in a boat
with them.</p>

then the brandy and spice; lastly the fruit, well dredged
with flour. Mix all thoroughly; wring out your pudding-cloth
in hot water; flour well inside, pour in the mixture,
and boil five hours.</p>

<p>I can confidently recommend this as the best plum pudding
I have ever tasted, even when the friend at whose
table I had first the pleasure of eating it imitated the
example of “good King Arthur’s” economical spouse, and
what we “couldn’t eat that night,” “next <i>day</i> fried,” by
heating a little butter in a frying-pan, and laying in slices
of her pudding, warmed them into almost their original
excellence. It will keep a long time—in a <i>locked</i> closet
or safe.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Roley-Poley.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make a light paste as for apple dumplings or valise
pudding, roll in an oblong sheet, and lay oranges (sweet
ones), peeled, sliced, and seeded, thickly all over it. Sprinkle
with white sugar; scatter a teaspoonful or two of the
grated yellow peel over all and roll up closely, folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
down the end to secure the syrup. Boil in a pudding-cloth
one hour and a half.</p>

<p>Eat with lemon sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry or Currant Pyramid.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Wash and stone the cherries, or pick the currants from
their stems. Make some good light crust, roll it out a
quarter of an inch thick, and cut for the bottom a round
piece about the size of a tea-plate. You can use the top
of a tin pail for a cutter. Spread your fruit upon this,
and sprinkle with sugar, leaving a half inch margin all
around. Roll out a second sheet an inch less in diameter
than the first, lay it carefully upon the fruit, and turn up
the margin of the lower piece over the edge of this. Spread
this, in turn, with fruit and sugar, and cover with a third
and lessening round; proceeding in this order until the
sixth and topmost cover is not more than three inches
across. Have ready a conical cap of stout muslin adapted
to the proportions and dimensions of your pile; dip it in
boiling water, flour inside, and draw gently over all. It
should be large enough to meet and tie under the base
without cramping the pyramid.</p>

<p>Boil two hours, and eat with sweet sauce.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FRITTERS, PANCAKES, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>


<p>Have plenty of nice sweet lard in which to fry fritters,
and test the heat by dropping in a teaspoonful before you
risk more. If right, the batter will rise quickly to the surface
in a puff-ball, spluttering and dancing, and will
speedily assume a rich golden-brown. Take up, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
done, with a skimmer, shaking it to dislodge any drops of
lard that may adhere; pile in a hot dish, sift sugar over
them, and send instantly to the table. Fry as many at a
time as the kettle will hold, and send in hot fresh ones
while the batter lasts. A round-bottomed saucepan or
kettle, rather wide at top, is best for frying them.</p>

<p>Use a frying-pan for pancakes; heat it; put in a teaspoonful
or two of lard and run it quickly over the bottom;
then pour in a large ladleful of batter—enough to cover
the bottom of the pan with a thin sheet. Turn with a tin
spatula, very carefully, to avoid tearing it. The frying-pan
should be a small one. Have ready a hot dish; turn
out the pancake upon it, cover with powdered sugar, and
roll up dexterously like a sheet of paper. Send half a
dozen to table at once, keeping them hot by setting the
dish in the oven until enough are baked.</p>

<p>I am thus explicit in these general instructions to save
myself the trouble, and the reader the tedium, of a repetition
under each receipt.</p>

<p>In olden times it was a boast of notable cooks that they
could toss a pancake from the pan out of the top of the
chimney with such accuracy of calculation, that it would
turn itself on the way back, and settle in its place, ready,
like St. Lawrence, to have the other side fried. <i>I</i> never
saw a pancake tossed, although in my childish days I saw
hundreds fried by the honorable tribe—now so fast passing
away—of Old Virginia cooks. I do not advise this
acrobatic system of culinary exploit, especially for beginners.
Indeed, I doubt if the pancakes would be found
equal to the journey in these days of tight chimney-throats
and cooking stoves. They must be out of practice as well
as their manufacturers. Be careful not to have too much
grease in the pan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<li>Some stale sponge, or <i>plain</i> cup cake, cut into rounds with a cake-cutter.</li>
<li>Hot lard.</li>
<li>Strawberry or other jam, or jelly.</li>
<li>A little boiling milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the cake carefully and fry a nice brown. Dip each
slice for a second in a bowl of boiling milk, draining this
off on the side of the vessel; lay on a hot dish and spread
thickly with strawberry jam, peach jelly, or other delicate
conserve. Pile them neatly and send around hot, with
cream to pour over them.</p>

<p>This is a nice way of using up stale cake, and if rightly
prepared, the dessert is almost equal to Neapolitan pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pancakes.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of flour.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt, and same of soda dissolved in vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Milk to make a <i>thin</i> batter. Begin with two cups and
add until the batter is of the right consistency. Beat the
yolks light, add the salt, soda, and two cups of milk, then
the flour and beaten whites alternately, and thin with
more milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly or Jam Pancakes.</span></h3>

<p>A batter as above. When the pancakes are fried, lay
upon a hot plate, spread quickly with nice jam or jelly,
and roll up neatly upon the preserves. Sprinkle lightly
with powdered sugar, and send around with wine sauce or
sweetened cream.</p>

<tr><td align="left">2 teaspoonfuls nutmeg.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Beat long and hard until several shades lighter in color
than at first, and creamy in consistency. Smooth into
shape with a broad knife dipped in cold water, and stamp
with a wooden mould, first scalded and then dipped in
cold water. Set upon the ice until the pudding is served.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bee-hive Sauce.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Mix a hard sauce according to the previous receipt,
and when light, set aside three or four tablespoonfuls in a
plate. To the larger quantity left add gradually, cherry,
currant, or cranberry juice enough to color it a good
pink. Red jelly will do if berries are out of season.
Beat the coloring matter in thoroughly, and shape into a
conical mound. Roll half a sheet of note-paper into a
long, narrow funnel, tie a string about it to keep it in
shape, and fill with the uncolored sauce. Squeeze it out
gently through the small end in a ridge, beginning at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
base of the cone and winding about it to the top, filling
your funnel as it is emptied, and guiding it carefully.
The effect of the alternate white-and pink lines is very
pretty.</p>

<p>If the pudding is one to which chocolate would be a
pleasant addition, color with grated chocolate, rubbed
smooth in a little of the wine, and ridge with white. Set
upon the ice or upon the cellar-floor until firm. Stick a
colored almond or other ornamental candy upon the top.</p>

<p>This bee-hive is easily made, and will set off even a
plain pudding handsomely.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brandy Sauce</span> (<i>hard.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ cup butter.</li>
<li>2 cups powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 wineglass brandy.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.</li>

</ul>

<p>Work the butter into the sugar, moistening, as you go
on, with boiling water. Beat long and hard until your
bowl is nearly full of a creamy mixture. Then add gradually
the wine and nutmeg, still beating hard. Turn into
a tin pail, set within a saucepan of boiling water, and
stir frequently until the sauce is hot, but <i>not</i> until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
boils. Take the saucepan from the fire and leave the pail
standing in the water, stirring the contents now and
then, until you are ready to serve the pudding.</p>

<p>If rightly made, this sauce will be nearly as white as
milk.</p>

<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar and beat in the egg whipped
light; the lemon and nutmeg. Beat hard ten minutes,
and add, a spoonful at a time, the boiling water. Put in
a tin pail and set within the uncovered top of the tea-kettle,
which you must keep boiling until the steam heats the
sauce very hot, but not to boiling. Stir constantly.</p>

the lemon, and nutmeg. Warm almost to a boil, stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
all the while; beat hard, put in the sugar, lastly the wine.
Set in a vessel of hot water stirring now and then, until it
is wanted. Keep it covered to hinder the escape of the
wine flavor. Stir well before pouring out.</p>

<p>This is a very fine sauce, particularly for cabinet and
Neopolitan puddings.</p>



<h3><span class="smcap">Custards, Blanc-Mange, Jellies, and Creams.</span></h3>

<p>A good rule for custard is five eggs to a quart of milk,
and a tablespoonful of sugar to each egg, although a good
plain custard can be made with an egg for each cup of
milk and four tablespoonfuls of sugar to the quart. Creams
and custards that are to be frozen must have at least one-third
more sugar than those which are not to undergo
this process.</p>

<p>In heating the milk for custard, do not let it quite boil
before adding the yolks. My plan, which has proved a
safe one thus far, is to take the scalding milk from the
fire, and instead of pouring the beaten eggs into it, to put
a spoonful or two of the milk to <i>them</i>, beating well all the
while, adding more and more milk as I mix, until there
is no longer danger of sudden curdling. Then, return all
to the fire and boil gently until the mixture is of the right
consistency. From ten to fifteen minutes should thicken
a quart. Stir constantly. A pinch of soda added in hot
weather will prevent the milk from curdling.</p>

<p><i>Always boil milk and custard in a vessel set within another
of boiling water.</i> If you have not a custard or farina kettle,
improvise one by setting a tin pail inside of a pot of
hot water, taking care it does not float, also that the
water is not so deep as to bubble over the top. Custards
are better and lighter if the yolks and whites are beaten
separately, the latter stirred in at the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Custard.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of five eggs and the whites of seven—(two for the méringue).</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring—1 teaspoonful to the pint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk almost to boiling; beat the yolks light
and stir in the sugar. Add the milk in the manner described
in “general directions” at head of this section;
stir in five whites whipped stiff; return to the fire and
stir until thick, but not until it breaks. Season it with
vanilla, pour into glass cups; whip the whites of two eggs
to a méringue with a heaping tablespoonful of powdered
sugar, and when the custard is cold, pile a little of this
upon the top of each cup. You may lay a preserved
strawberry or cherry, or a bit of melon sweetmeat, or a
little bright jelly upon each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Custards.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint milk (half cream).</li>
<li>¼ lb. almonds, blanched and pounded to a paste, a few at a time in a Wedgewood mortar, adding gradually—</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of rose-water.</li>
<li>Yolks of three eggs and whites of four—(two for méringue).</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful extract bitter almond in méringue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk, add the beaten yolks, the sugar, the
almond paste, and the whites of two eggs. Boil, stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
constantly until it thickens. Stir up well when almost
cold and pour into cups. Make a méringue of the whites
of two eggs and two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, flavored
with bitter almond, and heap upon each cup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quaking Custard.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 cups milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of four eggs—reserving the whites for méringue.</li>
<li>½ package Cooper’s or Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla or lemon flavoring. Juice of a lemon in méringue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine in a cup of the cold milk two hours.
Then heat the rest of the milk to boiling, add that in which
the gelatine is, and stir over the fire until the latter is
quite dissolved. Take from the fire, and let it stand five
minutes before putting in the beaten yolks and sugar.
Heat slowly until it begins to thicken perceptibly, not
boil—say seven or eight minutes, stirring constantly.
When nearly cold, having stirred it every few minutes
during the time, flavor it, wash out your mould in cold
water, and without wiping it, pour in the custard and set
on the ice or in a cold place to harden. When quite firm,
turn into a cold dish, loosening it by wrapping about the
mould a cloth wrung out in hot water, or dipping the
mould for an instant in warm, not boiling water. Have
ready the whites whipped to a froth with three tablespoonfuls
powdered sugar and juice of a lemon. Heap neatly
about the base of the moulded custard, like snow-drifts.
If you like, you may dot this with minute bits of currant
jelly.</p>

<p>This is a pleasing dish to the eye and taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Floating Island.</span> ✠</h3>

<li>5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls (heaping) white sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls extract bitter almond or vanilla.</li>
<li>½ cup currant jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks well, stir in the sugar, and add the hot,
not boiling milk, a little at a time. Boil until it begins
to thicken. When cool, flavor and pour into a glass dish,
first stirring it up well. Heap upon it a méringue of the
whites into which you have beaten, gradually, half a cup
of currant, cranberry, or other bright tart jelly. Dot
with bits of jelly cut into rings or stars, or straight slips
laid on in a pattern.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spanish Cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ box of gelatine.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of three eggs.</li>
<li>1 small cup of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine an hour in the milk; put on the fire
and stir well as it warms. Beat the yolks very light with
the sugar, add to the scalding milk, and heat to boiling
point, stirring all the while. Strain through thin muslin
or tarlatan, and when almost cold, put into a mould wet
with cold water. Flavor with vanilla or lemon.</p>

<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla or bitter almond extract.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in just enough cold water to cover it,
for an hour. Drain, and stir into a pint of the cream
made boiling hot. Beat the yolks smooth with the sugar,
and add the boiling mixture, beaten in a little at a time.
Heat until it begins to thicken, but do not actually boil;
remove it from the fire, flavor, and while it is still hot stir
in the other pint of cream, whipped or churned in a syllabub
churn to a stiff froth. Beat in this “whip,” a spoonful
at a time, into the custard until it is the consistency of
sponge-cake batter. Dip a mould in cold water, pour in
the mixture, and set on the ice to form.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in a teacupful of cold water.
To this, at the end of this time, add one pint boiling water.
Stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved; add two-thirds
of the sugar and the lemon-juice. Beat the whites
of the eggs to a stiff froth, and when the gelatine is quite
cold, whip it into the whites, a spoonful at a time, for
an hour. Whip steadily and evenly, and when all is stiff,
pour into a mould, previously wet with cold water, and
set in a cold place. In four or five hours turn into a glass

boiled, and a good pinch of salt. Stir until boiling hot,
and add gradually to the beaten yolks and sugar. Boil
again (<i>always</i> in a vessel set within another of hot water),
stirring constantly. Let it cook until thick, but not too
long, as the custard will break. Five minutes after it
reaches the boil will suffice. Pour into a bowl, and stir
gently into the mixture the whites of the eggs, beaten to
a stiff froth. Flavor, and set aside in a glass dish until
very cold.</p>

<p>Eat with an accompaniment of light cake and brandied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>

<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls corn-starch, wet in a little cold water.</li>
<li>3 eggs, well beaten—whites and yolks separately.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla, lemon, or other essence.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling; stir in the corn-starch and
salt, and boil together five minutes (in a farina-kettle),
then add the yolks, beaten light, with the sugar; boil two

<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Blanc-mange.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 cups of new milk.</li>
<li>2½ tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, wet up with cold milk.</li>
<li>¾ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla, lemon, or bitter almond flavoring, with a little white wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the arrowroot to a smooth batter with one cup of
the milk. Heat the remainder to boiling; add the arrowroot,
stirring constantly. When it begins to thicken put
in the sugar, and cook ten minutes longer, still stirring it
well from the sides and bottom. Take it off; beat well
five minutes; flavor with the essence and a small wineglass
of white wine. Give a hard final stir before putting
it into a mould wet with cold water.</p>

<p>This is very nourishing for invalids and young children.
For the latter you may omit the wine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Blanc-mange.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 oz. Cooper’s gelatine.</li>
<li>3 ozs. of almonds, blanched and pounded in a mortar, with</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of rose-water, added to prevent oiling.</li>
<li>¾ cup sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling, having previously soaked the
gelatine in a cup of it for an hour. Turn in this when the
milk is scalding hot; add the pounded almond-paste, and
stir all together ten minutes before putting in the sugar.
When the gelatine has dissolved, remove the blanc-mange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
from the vessel of boiling water in which you have cooked
it, and strain through a thin muslin bag, pressing it well
to get out the flavor of the almonds. There should be
three or four bitter ones among them. Wet a mould with
cold water, put in the blanc-mange, and set in a cold place
until firm.</p>

<p>You may make blanc-mange without the almonds,

<h3><span class="smcap">Neapolitan Blanc-mange.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make according to the foregoing receipt, and, after
straining, separate into four different portions, allowing
about a cupful of the mixture for each. Have ready</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 great tablespoonful chocolate, wet with a very little boiling water, and rubbed to a smooth paste, for the brown coloring.</li>
<li>Yolk of an egg beaten light for the yellow.</li>
<li>1 great tablespoonful of currant jelly for the pink.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the chocolate into one portion, mixing it well;
the jelly into another, the egg into a third, returning this
and that flavored with chocolate, to the fire, and stirring
until very hot, but not boiling. Leave the fourth uncolored.
When quite cold and a little stiff, pour carefully
into a wet mould—the white first; then the pink; next
the yellow; and the chocolate last. Of course, when the
blanc-mange is turned out, this order of colors will be reversed.
Set in a cold place. Loosen, when firm, by dipping
the mould for a moment in warm water, and working
the top free from the edge with a few light touches of
your fingers. This is a handsome dish and easily managed.
Currant juice or cranberry color a finer pink than
jelly, but are apt to thin the blanc-mange, unless used cautiously.
A little vanilla improves the chocolate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jaune-mange.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 oz. Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in half a cup cold water one hour.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>Yolks of four eggs beaten very light.</li>
<li>1 orange, juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 lemon, juice and one-third the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 cup white wine or clear pale Sherry.</li>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar and a good pinch cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the soaked gelatine in the boiling water until dissolved;
take from the fire and beat, a little at a time,
into the yolks; return to the inner saucepan with the
sugar, orange, lemon and cinnamon. Stir over a clear
fire until it is boiling hot; put in the wine and strain
through a hair-sieve or a piece of tarlatan. Set away in a
mould wet with cold water.</p>

<p>The success of this dish depends much upon the stirring
and the watchfulness of the cook. The mixture should
not be allowed to boil at any moment.</p>

<li>1 quart of gooseberries, ripe.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Yolks of four eggs.</li>
<li>Méringue of whites, and 3 tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the gooseberries in just water enough to cover
them. When soft and broken, rub them through a sieve
to remove the skins. While still hot beat in the butter,
sugar, and the whipped yolks of the eggs. Pile in a glass

<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s-Foot Jelly.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 calf’s feet, cleaned carefully.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 pint of wine.</li>
<li>3 cups of sugar—or sweeten to taste.</li>
<li>Whites of 3 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of nutmeg.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the calf’s feet in the water until it is reduced one
half; strain the liquor, and let it stand ten or twelve
hours. Skim off every particle of the fat, and remove the
dregs; melt slowly in a porcelain or bell-metal kettle, add
the seasoning, sugar, and the whipped whites of the eggs,
and boil fast about twelve minutes, skimming well. Strain
through a double flannel bag suspended between the four
legs of an upturned high stool or backless chair, the bowl
set beneath. Do not squeeze or shake it, until the jelly
ceases to run freely; then slip out the bowl, and put under
another, into which you may gently press what remains.
The first will be the clearer jelly, although the second
dripping will taste quite as well. Wet your moulds, put
in the jelly, and set in a cool place.</p>

<p>There are still some housekeepers who insist that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
jellies made from the modern gelatine are not comparable
in beauty and flavor to those prepared from the genuine
feet. Seeing means taste as well as belief with them, and
when they handle and behold the beloved feet, they know
what they are about. Gelatine, they will darkly and disgustfully
assert, is made of horn-shavings and hoofs and
the like, and no more fit to be used for cooking purposes
than so much glue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while gelatine is so clean, bright, and convenient,
housewives who find the days now but half as
long as did their mothers, despite labor-saving machines,
will turn a deaf ear to these alarmists, and escape the
tedious process above-described by using the valuable substitute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint of wine—pale Sherry or White.</li>
<li>1 cup of cold water.</li>
<li>1 package Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>Juice of two lemons and grated peel of one.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 good pinch of cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour. Add to
this the sugar, lemons, and cinnamon; pour over all a quart
of boiling water, and stir until the gelatine is thoroughly
dissolved. Put in the wine, strain through a double flannel
bag, without squeezing, wet your moulds with cold water,
and set the jelly away in them to cool.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cider Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>May be made by the receipt just given, substituting a
pint of clear, sweet cider for the wine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Fever patients may use cider jelly when wine is forbidden,
and they will find this both refreshing and nutritious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bird’s Nest in Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of jelly, made according to either of the receipts just given, but with a cup less of boiling water, that it may be very firm.</li>
<li>3 cups of white blanc-mange.</li>
<li>9 empty eggshells.</li>
<li>Fresh rinds of two oranges.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the rind from the oranges in long narrow strips,
and stew these gently in enough water to cover them until
they are tender. Add to them a cup of sugar, and
simmer fifteen minutes longer in the syrup. Lay them
out upon a dish to cool, taking care not to break them.
If you have preserved orange-peel in the house, it will
save you the trouble of preparing this.</p>

<p>The blanc-mange should be made the day before you
want it, and the eggshells filled. The original contents,
yolk and white, should be poured out through a hole, not
larger than a half-dime, in the small end, and the interior
washed with pure water, shaken around well in them.
Then fill with blanc-mange and set in a pan of flour or
sugar—the open end up—that they may not be jostled or
overturned.</p>

<p>Next morning fill a glass dish two-thirds full of the
jelly, which should be very clear, reserving a large cupful.
Break the shells from about the blanc-mange, and lay the
artificial eggs upon the jelly so soon as the latter is firm
enough to bear them. Pile them neatly, but not too high
in the middle, bearing in mind that what is the top now
will be the bottom when the jelly is turned out. Lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
orange peel which represents <i>straw</i>, over these and around
them. Warm the reserved jelly, so that it will flow
readily, but do not get it hot; pour over the straw and
eggs, and set away in a cold place to form. When firm,
turn out upon a glass dish or salver.</p>

<p>This pretty and fanciful dish is yet easily made. The
materials are so simple and inexpensive, and the effect of
the work, if deftly done, so pleasing, that I have no hesitation
in calling the attention even of novices to it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Jelly</span> (<i>boiled.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 box Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 1 pint of cold water one hour.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water poured over this, and stirred until the gelatine is dissolved.</li>
<li>1½ lb. white sugar.</li>
<li>2 lemons—juice and peel.</li>
<li>1 pint of wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all over the fire, boil up once well, and strain
through a double flannel bag into moulds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 oranges—juice of both and grated rind of one.</li>
<li>1 lemon—juice and peel.</li>
<li>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in a very little water, one hour.</li>
<li>1 quart boiling water.</li>
<li>1½ cup sugar, and 1 small cup of wine.</li>
<li>1 good pinch of cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Squeeze the juice of the fruit into a bowl, and put
with them the grated peel and the cinnamon. Pour over
them the boiling water, cover closely, and let them stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
half an hour. Strain, add the sugar, let it come to a boil,
stir in the gelatine, and, when this is well dissolved, take
the saucepan from the fire. Strain through a double
flannel bag into moulds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Variegated Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of clear jelly.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful prepared cochineal or red currant juice.</li>
<li>1 cup white blanc-mange.</li>
</ul>

<p>Divide the jelly into two equal portions, and color one
with a <i>very</i> little prepared cochineal, leaving the other as
it is, of a pale amber. Wet a mould with cold water and
pour in a little of the latter. Set the mould in the ice,
that the jelly may harden quickly, and so soon as it is firm
pour in carefully some of the red. Set back upon the ice
to get ready for the amber, adding the two colors in this
order until you are ready for the base, which should be
wider than the other stripes, and consist of the white
blanc-mange. Keep both jelly and blanc-mange near the
fire until you have filled the mould—I mean, of course,
that intended for the latest layers. Let all get very firm
before you turn it out.</p>

<p>You may vary two moulds of this jelly by having the
blanc-mange base of one colored with chocolate, a narrow
white stripe above relieving the grave effect of the brown.</p>



<h3><span class="smcap">Ice-cream and other Ices.</span></h3>

<p>If you wish to prepare ice-cream at an hour’s notice,
you cannot do better than to purchase the best patent
freezer you can procure. I had one once which would
freeze cream admirably in half an hour. I have forgotten
the patentee’s name, and perhaps this is well for him,
since truth would oblige me to record an unlucky habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
his machine had of getting out of order just when I wanted
it to do its best. My earliest recollections of ice-cream
are of the discordant grinding of the well-worn freezer
among the blocks of ice packed about it—a monotone of
misery, that, had it been unrelieved by agreeable associations
of the good to which it was “leading up,” would not
have been tolerated out of Bedlam. For one, two, three,
sometimes four hours, it went on without other variety
than the harsher sounds of the fresh ice and the rattling
“swash” as the freezer plunged amid the icy brine when
these were nearly melted; without cessation save when the
unhappy operator nodded over his work, or was relieved
by another predestined victim of luxury and ennui—a
battalion of the laziest juveniles upon the place being detailed
for this purpose. I verily believed in those days
that the freezing could not be facilitated by energetic action,
and used to think how fortunate it was that small
darkies had a predilection for this drowsy employment.
I shall never forget my amazement at seeing a brisk Yankee
housewife lay hold of the handle of the ponderous tin
cylinder, and whirl it with such will and celerity, back
and forth, back and forth, that the desired end came to
pass in three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>That day has gone by. Time has grown too precious
now even to juvenile contrabands for them to sit half the
day shaking a freezer under the locust-tree on the old
plantation lawn. Machines that will do the work in one-tenth
of the time, with one-fiftieth of the labor, are sold
at every corner. But, so far as I know, it was reserved
for a nice old lady up in the “Jersey” mountains—the
tidiest, thriftiest, most cheerful bee I ever knew—to show
her neighbors and acquaintances that ice-cream could be
made to freeze itself. For twelve years I have practised
her method, with such thankfulness to her, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
satisfaction to my guests and family, that I eagerly embrace
the opportunity of circulating the good news.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Self-freezing Ice-Cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart rich milk.</li>
<li>8 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately and very light.</li>
<li>4 cups sugar.</li>
<li>3 pints rich sweet cream.</li>
<li>5 teaspoonfuls vanilla or other seasoning, or 1 vanilla bean, broken in two, boiled in the custard, and left in until it is cold.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the <i>milk</i> almost to boiling, beat the eggs light, add
the sugar, and stir up well. Pour the hot milk to this,
little by little, beating all the while, and return to the fire—boiling
in a pail or saucepan set within one of hot water.
Stir the mixture steadily about fifteen minutes, or until it
is thick as boiled custard. Pour into a bowl and set aside
to cool. When quite cold, beat in the cream, and the
flavoring, unless you have used the bean.</p>

<p>Have ready a quantity of ice, cracked in pieces not
larger than a pigeon egg—the smaller the better. You
can manage this easily by laying a great lump of ice between
two folds of coarse sacking or an old carpet, tucking
it in snugly, and battering it, through the cloth, with a
sledge-hammer or mallet until fine enough. There is no
waste of ice, nor need you take it in your hands at all—only
gather up the corners of the carpet or cloth, and slide
as much as you want into the outer vessel. Use an ordinary
old-fashioned upright freezer, set in a deep pail; pack
around it closely, first, a layer of pounded ice, then one of
rock salt—<i>common salt will not do so well</i>. In this order
fill the pail; but before covering the freezer-lid, remove it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
carefully that none of the salt may get in, and, with a long
wooden ladle or flat stick (I had one made on purpose),
beat the custard as you would batter, for five minutes,
without stay or stint. Replace the lid, pack the ice and
salt upon it, patting it down hard on top; cover all
with several folds of blanket or carpet, and leave it for one
hour. Then remove the cover of the freezer when you
have wiped it carefully outside. You will find within a
thick coating of frozen custard upon the bottom and sides.
Dislodge this with your ladle, which should be thin at the
lower end, or with a long carving-knife, working every
particle of it clear. Beat again hard and long until the
custard is a smooth, half-congealed paste. The smoothness
of the ice-cream depends upon your action at this juncture.
Put on the cover, pack in more ice and salt, and turn off
the brine. Spread the double carpet over all once more,
having buried the freezer out of sight in ice, and leave it
for three or four hours. Then, if the water has accumulated
in such quantity as to buoy up the freezer, pour it
off, fill up with ice and salt, but do not open the freezer. In
two hours more you may take it from the ice, open it, wrap
a towel, wrung out in boiling water, about the lower part,
and turn out a solid column of cream, firm, close-grained,
and smooth as velvet to the tongue.</p>

<p>Should the ice melt very fast, you may have to turn off
the water more than twice; but this will seldom happen
except in very hot weather. You need not devote fifteen
minutes in all to the business after the custard is made.
You may go into the cellar before breakfast, having made
the custard overnight, stir in the cold cream and flavoring,
get it into the freezer and comfortably packed down before
John has finished shaving, and by choosing the times for
your stolen visits to the lower regions, surprise him and
the children at a one-o’clock dinner by the most delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
dessert in the world. I have often laughed in my sleeve
at seeing <i>my</i> John walk through the cellar in search of
some mislaid basket or box, whistling carelessly, without
a suspicion that his favorite delicacy was coolly working
out its own solidification under the inverted barrel on
which I chanced to be leaning at his entrance.</p>

<p>Any of the following receipts for <i>custard</i> ice-cream may
be frozen in like manner. Do not spare salt, and be sure
your ice is finely cracked, and after the second beating do
not let the air again into the freezer. If you cannot get
dry rock salt, that which settles at the bottom of fish-barrels
will do just as well. Keep the freezer hidden, from
first to last, by the ice heaped over it, except when you
have to lift the lid on the occasions I have specified.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>3 oz. sweet almonds and 1 oz. of bitter, blanched, and, when cold, pounded to a paste, a few at a time, in a Wedgewood mortar, adding</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of rose-water to prevent oiling.</li>
<li>3 pints cream—fresh and sweet.</li>
<li>Nearly 2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of arrowroot, wet up with cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat one pint cream almost to boiling, add the sugar,
and when this is melted, the almonds. Simmer ten minutes,
stirring often, remove from the fire, and let it stand together
ten minutes longer in a covered vessel. Strain
the cream, pressing the bag hard to get the full flavor of
the almonds, return to the inner saucepan and stir in the
arrowroot until the cream thickens—say five minutes.
When cold, beat very light with an egg-whip, adding
gradually the rest of the cream. It should be light in
half an hour. Then freeze.</p>

<p>If you wish to mould your cream in fancy shapes, open
your freezer two hours after the second stirring and transfer
the cream to a tight mould, having given it a third
vigorous beating. Pack this down in ice and salt, and
let it stand two hours longer than you would have done
had it remained in the freezer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Ice-cream.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 pints of cream.</li>
<li>1 cup of black coffee—very strong and clear.</li>
<li>2 cups sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls arrowroot, wet up with cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat half the cream nearly to boiling, stir in the sugar,
and, when this is melted, the coffee; then the arrowroot.
Boil all together five minutes, stirring constantly. When
cold, beat up very light, whipping in the rest of the
cream by degrees. Then freeze.</p>

<p>I cannot say certainly that this can be frozen without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
turning, although I see no reason why it should not, since
the arrowroot gives it the consistency of custard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Italian Cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 pints of cream.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>2 lemons—juice and grated peel.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sweeten the cream and beat in the lemons gradually,
not to curdle it; add the brandy and freeze in a patent
freezer, or by turning quickly. In turning the freezer,
open twice during the operation, to stir and beat the contents
smooth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Ice-cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart cream.</li>
<li>2 lemons—the juice of one and the grated peel of one and a half.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sweeten the cream, beat the lemon gradually into it,
and put at once into the freezer. Freeze rapidly in a
patent freezer, or the acid is apt to turn the milk.</p>

<p>You may make orange ice-cream in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pine-apple Ice-cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of cream.</li>
<li>1 large ripe pine-apple.</li>
<li>1 lb. powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the pine-apple thin, and scatter the sugar between
the slices. Cover it, and let the fruit steep three hours.
Then cut, or chop it up in the syrup, and strain it through
a hair sieve or bag of double coarse lace. Beat gradually
into the cream, and freeze as rapidly as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>You may, if you like, reserve a few pieces of pine-apple,
unsugared, cut into square bits, and stir them through the
cream when half frozen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Ice-cream</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is very nice made after the preceding receipt, with two or
three handfuls of freshly cut bits of the fruit stirred in
when the cream is half frozen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry or Strawberry Ice-cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart ripe sweet berries.</li>
<li>1 lb. sugar.</li>
<li>1 quart fresh cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scatter half the sugar over the berries and let them
stand three hours. Press and mash them, and strain them
through a thin muslin bag. Add the rest of the sugar,
and when dissolved beat in the cream little by little.
Freeze rapidly, opening the freezer (if it is not a patent
one) several times to beat and stir.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>You may have a pint of whole berries, unsugared, ready
to stir in when the cream is frozen to the consistency of
stiff mush. In this case add a cup more sugar to the
quart of crushed berries.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frozen Custard with the Fruit Frozen in.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>1 quart cream.</li>
<li>6 eggs, and three cups of sugar beaten up with the yolks.</li>
<li>1 pint fresh peaches, cut up small, or fresh ripe berries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the quart of milk almost to boiling, and add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
gradually to the beaten yolks and sugar. Whip in the
frothed whites, return to the custard-kettle, and stir until
it is a thick, soft custard. Let it get perfectly cold, beat
in the cream and freeze. If you let it freeze itself, stir in
the fruit after the second beating; if you turn the freezer,
when the custard is like congealed mush.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tutti Frutti Ice-cream.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 quart of cream.</li>
<li>Yolks of 5 eggs—beaten light with the sugar.</li>
<li>3 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 lemon—juice and grated peel.</li>
<li>1 glass of pale Sherry, and ½ lb. crystallized fruits, chopped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk almost to boiling; pour by degrees over
the eggs and sugar, beating all together well. Return to
the fire, and <i>boil</i> ten minutes, or until set into a good custard.
When cold, beat in the cream, and half freeze before
you stir in half a pound of crystallized fruit—peaches,
apricots, cherries, limes, etc., chopped very fine. Beat in
with these the lemon and wine; cover again, and freeze
hard.</p>

<p>In all fruit ice-creams the beating of the custard should
be very hard and thorough, if you would have them
smooth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Ice.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 lemons—juice of all, and grated peel of three.</li>
<li>1 large sweet orange—juice and rind.</li>
<li>1 pint of water.</li>
<li>1 pint of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Squeeze out every drop of juice, and steep in it the rind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
of orange and lemons one hour. Strain, squeezing the
bag dry; mix in the sugar, and then the water. Stir until
dissolved, and freeze by turning in a freezer—opening
three times to beat all up together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Ice.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 oranges—juice of all, and grated peel of three.</li>
<li>2 lemons—the juice only.</li>
<li>1 pint of sugar dissolved in 1 pint of water.</li>

<p>Prepare and freeze as you would lemon ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pineapple Ice.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 juicy ripe pineapple—peeled and cut small.</li>
<li>Juice and grated peel of 1 lemon.</li>
<li>1 pint of sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint water, or a little less.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strew the sugar over the pineapple and let it stand an
hour. Mash all up together, and strain out the syrup
through a hair-sieve. Add the water and freeze.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Ice.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart cherries, with half the stones pounded in a Wedgewood mortar.</li>
<li>2 lemons—the juice only.</li>
<li>1 pint of water, in which dissolve 1 pint of sugar.</li>
<li>1 glass of fine brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Squeeze out the bruised cherries and stones, in a bag
over the sugar; add the water, then the brandy, and
freeze.</p>

<p>It will require a longer time to freeze than other ices,
on account of the brandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant and Raspberry Ice</span> (<i>Fine.</i>)</h3>

<h2>RIPE FRUIT FOR DESSERT.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oranges</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>May be put on whole in fruit-baskets, or the skin be cut
in eighths half way down, separated from the fruit and
curled inward, showing half the orange white, the other
yellow. Or, pass a sharp knife lightly around the fruit,
midway between the stem and blossom end, cutting through
the rind only. Slip the smooth curved handle of a teaspoon
carefully between the peel and body of the orange,
and gently work it all around until both upper and lower
halves are free, except at stem and blossom. Turn the
rind, without tearing it, inside out, making a white cup at
each end—the round white fruit between them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salade d’Orange.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice large sweet oranges; sprinkle powdered
sugar thickly over each slice, and pour a couple of glasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
of wine on the top. Sprinkle powdered sugar over all,
and serve at once, or the fruit will lose its freshness.</p>

<p>You may omit the wine if you like.</p>

<p>Do not let any fruit intended to be eaten fresh for
dessert lie in the sugar longer than is absolutely necessary.
It extracts the flavor and withers the pulp.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ambrosia.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>8 fine sweet oranges, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>½ grated cocoanut.</li>
<li>½ cup powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrange the orange in a glass dish, scatter the grated
cocoanut thickly over it, sprinkle this lightly with sugar,
and cover with another layer of orange. Fill up the dish
in this order, having cocoanut and sugar for the top layer.
Serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and polish with a clean towel, and pile in a china
fruit-basket, with an eye to agreeable variety of color.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peaches and Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Pick out the finest, handling as little as may be, and
pile upon a salver or flat dish, with bits of ice between
them, and ornament with peach leaves or fennel sprigs.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest dishes of fruit I ever saw upon a
dessert-table was an open silver basket, wide at the top,
heaped with rich red peaches and yellow Bartlett pears,
interspersed with feathery bunches of green, which few of
those who admired it knew for <i>carrot-tops</i>. Wild white
clematis wreathed the handle and showed here and there
among the fruit, while scarlet and white verbenas nestled
amid the green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Send around powdered sugar with the fruit, as many
like to dip peaches and pears in it after paring and quartering
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberries, Raspberries, and Blackberries.</span></h3>

<p>Never wash strawberries or raspberries that are intended
to be eaten as <i>fresh</i> fruit. If they are so gritty as
to require this process, keep them off the table. You will
certainly ruin the flavor beyond repair if you wash them,
and as certainly induce instant fermentation and endanger
the coats of the eaters’ stomachs, if, after profaning
the exquisite delicacy of the fruit to this extent, you complete
the evil work by covering them with sugar, and
leaving them to leak their lives sourly away for one or
two hours.</p>

<p>Put them on the table in glass dishes, piling them high
and lightly, send around powdered sugar with them
and cream, that the guests may help themselves. It is
not economical perhaps, but it is a healthful and pleasant
style of serving them—I had almost said the only decent
one.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know who picked them!” cries Mrs.
Fussy.</p>

<p>No, my dear madam! nor do you know who makes
the baker’s bread, or confectioner’s cakes, creams, jellies,
salads, etc. Nor, for that matter, how the flour is manufactured
out of which you conjure your dainty biscuit and
pies. I was so foolish as to go into a flour-mill once, and
having seen a burly negro, naked to the waist, with his
trousers rolled up to his knees, stand in a bank of “fine
family flour,” a foot deep in the lowest part, on a July
day, shovelling it into barrels for the market, I rushed
into the outer air a sicker and a wiser woman.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> made strawberries. “Doubtless,” says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Bishop Butler, “<span class="smcap">He</span> could have made a better berry, but
<span class="smcap">He</span> never did!” The picker’s light touch cannot mar
flavor or beauty, nor, were her fingers filthy as a chimney-sweep’s,
could the delicate fruit suffer from them as from
your barbarous baptism. You would like to know who
picked them. I should inquire instead, “Who washed
them, and in what?” I recollect seeing a housekeeper,
who was afflicted with your inquiring turn of mind, wash
strawberries in a wash-hand basin!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currants and Raspberries.</span></h3>

<p>Pick the currants from the stems, and mix with an
equal quantity of raspberries. Put into a glass bowl, and
eat with powdered sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frosted Currants.</span></h3>

<p>Pick fine even bunches, and dip them, one at a time,
into a mixture of frothed white of egg, and a very little
cold water. Drain them until nearly dry, and roll in
pulverized sugar. Repeat the dip in the sugar once or
twice, and lay them upon white paper to dry. They
make a beautiful garnish for jellies or charlottes, and look
well heaped in a dish by themselves or with other fruit.</p>

<p>Plums and grapes are very nice frosted in the same
way.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES.</h2>

<p>Use none but porcelain, or <i>good</i> bell-metal kettles for
preserves and jellies. If the latter, clean thoroughly just
before you put in the syrup or fruit. Scour with sand,
then set it over the fire, with a cupful of vinegar and a
large handful of salt in it. Let this come to a boil, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
scour the whole of the inside of the kettle with it. Do
not let your preserves or anything else stand one moment
in it after it is withdrawn from the fire; fill the emptied
kettle instantly with water and wash it perfectly clean,
although you may mean to return the syrup to it again in
five minutes. By observing these precautions, preserves
and pickles made in bell-metal may be rendered as good
and wholesome as if the frailer porcelain be used.</p>

<p>Use only fine sugar for nice preserves. Moist or dark
sugar cannot be made to produce the same effect as dry
white.</p>

<p>Do not hurry any needful step in the process of preserving.
Prepare your fruit with care, weigh accurately, and
allow time enough to do your work well. Put up the preserves
in small jars in preference to large, and, when once
made, keep them in a cool, dark closet that is perfectly
dry. Keep jellies in small stone china jars, or glass tumblers
closely covered. You can procure at most china
and glass stores, or house-furnishing establishments, metal
covers with elastic rims for these, which can be used from
year to year.</p>

<p>Cover jellies and jams with tissue paper, double and
wet with brandy, pressed closely to the conserve before
you put on the lid, or paste on the thick paper. Examine
your shelves frequently and narrowly for a few weeks to
see if your preserves are keeping well. If there is the
least sign of fermentation, boil them over, adding more
sugar.</p>

<p>If jellies are not so firm after six or eight hours as you
would have them, set them in the sun, with bits of window
glass over them to keep out the dust and insects. Remove
these at night and wipe off the moisture collected on the
under sides. Repeat this every day until the jelly shrinks
into firmness, filling up one cup from another as need requires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
This method is far preferable to boiling down,
which both injures the flavor and darkens the jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Peaches.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Weigh the fruit after it is pared and the stones extracted,
and allow a pound of sugar to every one of
peaches. Crack one-quarter of the stones, extract the
kernels, break them to pieces and boil in just enough water
to cover them, until soft, when set aside to steep in a
covered vessel. Put a layer of sugar at the bottom of the
kettle, then one of fruit, and so on until you have used up
all of both; set it where it will warm slowly until the sugar
is melted and the fruit hot through. Then strain the
kernel-water and add it. Boil steadily until the peaches
are tender and clear. Take them out with a perforated
skimmer and lay upon large flat dishes, crowding as little
as possible. Boil the syrup almost to a jelly—that is,
until clear and thick, skimming off all the scum. Fill
your jars two-thirds full of the peaches, pour on the boiling
syrup, and, when cold, cover with brandy tissue-paper,
then with cloth, lastly with thick paper tied tightly over
them.</p>

<p>The peaches should be ready to take off after half an
hour’s boiling; the syrup be boiled fifteen minutes longer,
<i>fast</i>, and often stirred, to throw up the scum. A few
slices of pineapple cut up with the peaches flavor them
finely.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Pears</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are put up precisely as are peaches, but are only pared,
not divided. Leave the stems on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Marmalade.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, stone, and weigh the fruit; heat slowly to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
out the juice, stirring up often from the bottom with a
wooden spoon. After it is hot, boil quickly, still stirring,
three-quarters of an hour. Add, then, the sugar, allowing
three-quarters of a pound to each pound of the fruit. Boil
up well for five minutes, taking off every particle of scum.
Add the juice of a lemon for every three pounds of fruit,
and a very little water in which one-fourth of the kernels
have been boiled and steeped. Stew all together ten minutes,
stirring to a smooth paste, and take from the fire.
Put up hot in air-tight cans, or, when cold, in small stone or
glass jars, with brandied tissue-paper fitted neatly to the
surface of the marmalade.</p>

<p>A large, ripe pineapple, pared and cut up fine, and
stirred with the peaches, is a fine addition to the flavor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Quinces.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Choose fine yellow quinces. Pare, quarter, and core
them, saving both skins and cores. Put the quinces over
the fire with just enough water to cover them, and simmer
until they are soft, but not until they begin to break.
Take them out carefully, and spread them upon broad
dishes to cool. Add the parings, seeds, and cores, to the
water in which the quinces were boiled, and stew, closely
covered, for an hour. Strain through a jelly-bag, and to
every pint of this liquor allow a pound of sugar. Boil up
and skim it, put in the fruit and boil fifteen minutes.
Take all from the fire and pour into a large deep pan.
Cover closely and let it stand twenty-four hours. Drain
off the syrup and let it come to a boil; put in the quinces
carefully and boil another quarter of an hour. Take them
up as dry as possible, and again spread out upon dishes,
setting these in the hottest sunshine you can find. Boil
the syrup until it begins to jelly; fill the jars two-thirds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
full and cover with the syrup. The preserves should be
of a fine red. Cover with brandied tissue-paper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Apples.</span></h3>

<p>Firm, well-flavored pippins or bell-flower apples make
an excellent preserve, prepared in the same manner as
quinces. A few quinces cut up among them, or the juice
of two lemons to every three pounds of fruit improves
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quince Marmalade.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice the quinces, stewing the skins, cores,
and seed in a vessel by themselves, with just enough water
to cover them. When this has simmered long enough to
extract all the flavor, and the parings are broken to pieces,
strain off the water through a thick cloth. Put the
quinces into the preserve-kettle when this water is almost
cold, pour it over them and boil, stirring and mashing the
fruit with a wooden spoon as it becomes soft. The juice
of two oranges to every three pounds of the fruit imparts
an agreeable flavor. When you have reduced all to a
smooth paste, stir in a scant three-quarters of a pound of
sugar for every pound of fruit; boil ten minutes more,
stirring constantly. Take off, and when cool put into
small jars, with brandied papers over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quince Cheese</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is marmalade boiled down <i>very</i> thick, packed into small
pots. It will turn out as firm as cheese, and can be cut
in slices for luncheon or tea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Butter.</span></h3>

<p>This is generally made by the large quantity.</p>

<p>Boil down a kettleful of cider to two-thirds the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
quantity. Pare, core, and slice juicy apples, and put as
many into the cider as it will cover. Boil slowly, stirring
often with a flat stick, and when the apples are tender to
breaking, take them out with a perforated skimmer, draining
well against the sides of the kettle. Put in a second
supply of apples and stew them soft, as many as the cider
will hold. Take from the fire, pour all together into a tub
or large crock; cover and let it stand twelve hours. Then
return to the kettle and boil down, stirring all the while
until it is the consistency of soft soap, and brown in color.
You may spice to taste if you please.</p>

<p>Keep in stone jars in a dry, cool place. It should keep
all winter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Crab-apples.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>The red Siberian crab is best for this purpose. Pick
out those that are nearly perfect, <i>leaving the stems on</i>, and
put into a preserve-kettle, with enough warm water to
cover them. Heat this to boiling, slowly, and simmer
until the skins break. Drain, cool, and skin them; then,
with a penknife, extract the cores through the blossom
ends. Weigh them; allow a pound and a quarter of
sugar and a teacupful of water to every pound of fruit.
Boil the water and sugar together until the scum ceases
to rise; put in the fruit, cover the kettle, and simmer
until the apples are a clear red, and tender. Take out
with a skimmer; spread upon dishes to cool and harden;
add to the syrup the juice of one lemon to three pounds of
fruit, and boil until clear and rich. Fill your jars three-quarters
full of the apples, pour the syrup in, and, when
cool, tie up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Green-gages and Large Purple
Plums.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Weigh the fruit and scald in boiling water to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the skins come off easily. Let them stand in a large bowl
an hour after they are peeled, that the juice may exude.
Drain this off; lay the plums in the kettle, alternately
with layers of sugar, allowing pound for pound; pour the
juice over the top and heat slowly to a boil. Take out
the plums at this point, very carefully, with a perforated
skimmer, draining them well through it, and spread upon
broad dishes in the sun. Boil the syrup until thick and
clear, skimming it faithfully. Return the plums to this,
and boil ten minutes. Spread out again until cool and
firm; keeping the syrup hot on the fire, fill your jars three-quarters
full of the fruit; pour on the scalding syrup,
cover to keep in the heat, and, when cold, tie up.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If you do not care to take the trouble of peeling the fruit,
prick it in several places with a needle, and proceed as
directed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Unique Preserves.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Gather young cucumbers, a little longer than your
middle finger, and lay in strong brine one week. Wash
them and soak a day and a night in fair water, changing
this four times. Line a bell-metal kettle with vine-leaves,
lay in the cucumbers, with a little alum scattered among
them; fill up with clear water; cover with vine-leaves,
then with a close lid, and green as for pickles. Do not
let them boil. When well greened, drop in ice-water.
When perfectly cold, wipe, and with a small knife slit
down one side; dig out the seeds; stuff with a mixture of
chopped raisins and citron; sew up the incision with fine
thread. Weigh them, and make a syrup, allowing a
pound of sugar for every one of cucumbers, with a pint
of water. Heat to a lively boil, skim, and drop in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
<i>fruit</i>. Simmer half an hour, take out and spread upon
a dish in the sun while you boil down the syrup, with a
few slices of ginger-root added. When thick, put in the
cucumbers again; simmer five minutes and put up in glass
jars; tying them up when cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Damsons</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are put up in the same manner as plums, but pricked
instead of skinned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Orange Peel.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>) ✠</h3>

<p>Weigh the oranges whole, and allow pound for pound.
Peel the oranges neatly and cut the rind into narrow
shreds. Boil until tender, changing the water twice, and
replenishing with hot from the kettle. Squeeze the <i>strained</i>
juice of the oranges over the sugar; let this heat to a boil;
put in the shreds and boil twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Lemon peel can be preserved in the same way, allowing
more sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Marmalade.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Allow pound for pound. Pare half the oranges and cut
the rind into shreds. Boil in three waters until tender,
and set aside. Grate the rind of the remaining oranges;
take off and throw away every bit of the thick white inner
skin; quarter all the oranges and take out the seeds.
Chop, or cut them into small pieces; drain all the juice
that will come away, without pressing them, over the
sugar; heat this, stirring until the sugar is dissolved,
adding a <i>very</i> little water, unless the oranges are very
juicy. Boil and skim five or six minutes; put in the
boiled shreds, and cook ten minutes; then the chopped
fruit and grated peel, and boil twenty minutes longer.
When cold, put into small jars, tied up with bladder or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
with paper next the fruit, cloths dipped in wax over all.
A nicer way still is to put away in tumblers with self-adjusting
metal tops. Press brandied tissue-paper down
closely to the fruit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Marmalade</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made as you would prepare orange—allowing a pound
and a quarter of sugar to a pound of the fruit, and using
but half the grated peel.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Pineapple.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, cut into slices, take out the core of each one, and
weigh, allowing pound for pound of sugar and fruit. Put
in alternate layers in the kettle and pour in water, allowing
a teacupful to each pound of sugar. Heat to a boil;
take out the pineapple and spread upon dishes in the sun.
Boil and skim the syrup half an hour. Return the pineapple
to the kettle and boil fifteen minutes. Take it out,
pack in wide-mouthed jars, pour on the scalding syrup;
cover to keep in the heat, and, when cold, tie up, first
putting brandied tissue-paper upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pineapple Marmalade.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, core, and weigh the pineapple; then cut
into small bits. Make a syrup of a teacup of water to two
pounds of sugar; melt, and heat to a boil. Heat the
chopped pineapple in a vessel set within one of boiling
water, covering it closely to keep in the flavor. When it
is smoking hot all through, and begins to look clear, add
to the syrup. Boil together half an hour, stirring all the
while, or until it is a clear, bright paste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Citron or Water-melon Rind.</span></h3>

<p>Pare off the green skin, and the soft, white, inner
rind. Cut into strips or into fanciful shapes. Allow a
pound and a quarter of sugar to each pound of rind.
Line your kettle with vine leaves and fill with the rind,
scattering a little pulverized alum over each layer. Cover
with vine-leaves, three thick; pour on water enough to
reach and wet these, and lay a close lid on the top of the
kettle. Let all steam together for three hours; but the
water must not actually boil. Take out your rind, which
should be well greened by this process, and throw at once
into very cold water. It should lie in soak, changing the
water every hour, for four hours.</p>

<p>For the syrup, allow two cups of water to a pound and
a quarter of sugar. Boil, and skim it until no more scum
comes up; put in the rind, and simmer gently nearly an
hour. Take it out, and spread upon dishes in the sun
until firm and almost cool. Simmer in the syrup for half
an hour; spread out again, and, when firm, put into a
large bowl, and pour over it the scalding syrup.</p>

<p>Twelve hours later put the syrup again over the fire,
adding the juice of a lemon and a tiny strip of ginger-root
for every pound of rind. Boil down until thick; pack
the rind in jars and pour over it the syrup. Tie up when
cool.</p>

<p>A very handsome sweetmeat, although rather insipid in
flavor. The reader can judge whether, as the charity boy
said of the alphabet, and the senior Weller of matrimony,
it is worth while to go through so much and get so little.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Ginger.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare the roots of fresh green ginger and lay in cold
water fifteen minutes. Boil in three waters, changing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
hot for cold every time, until very tender; drain, and lay
in ice-water. For the syrup, allow a pound and a quarter
of sugar for every pound of ginger, and a cupful of water
for each pound of sugar. Boil, and skim until the scum
ceases to rise. When the syrup is <i>cold</i>, wipe the ginger
dry and drop it in. Let it stand twenty-four hours. Drain
off and reheat the syrup. This time put the ginger in
when blood warm. Do not look at it again for two days.
Then reboil the syrup, and pour over the ginger scalding
hot. In a week drain off once more, boil, and add again
while hot to the ginger; cover closely. It will be fit for
use in a fortnight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Cherries.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Stone the cherries, preserving every drop of juice. Weigh
the fruit, allowing pound for pound of sugar. Put a layer
of fruit for one of sugar until all is used up; pour over the
juice and boil gently until the syrup begins to thicken.</p>

<p>The short-stem red cherries, or the Morellas are best for
preserves. Sweet cherries will not do.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Strawberries.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pound for pound. Put them in a preserving kettle over
a slow fire until the sugar melts. Boil twenty-five minutes,
fast. Take out the fruit in a perforated skimmer and fill
a number of small cans three-quarters full. Boil and skim
the syrup five minutes longer, fill up the jars, and seal
while hot.</p>

<p>Keep in a cool, dry place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Jam.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>For every pound of fruit three-quarters of a pound of sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint red currant juice to every 4 pounds strawberries.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the juice of the currants with the strawberries half
an hour, stirring all the time. Add the sugar when you
have dipped out nearly all the juice, leaving the fruit
quite dry, and boil up rapidly for about twenty minutes,
skimming carefully. Put in small jars, with brandied tissue-paper
over the top.</p>

<p>You can omit the currant juice, but the flavor will not
be so fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry Jam.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>¾ lb. of sugar to every lb. fruit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the fruit on alone, or with the addition of a pint of
currant juice to every four pounds of fruit. Boil half an
hour, mashing and stirring well. Dip out most of the
boiling juice before adding sugar, and cook twenty minutes
more. Blackberry jam is very nice made as above, leaving
out the currant juice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gooseberry Jam</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made in the same manner as raspberry, only the currant
juice is omitted, and the gooseberries boiled one hour
without the fruit, and another after it is put in. The
fruit must be ripe.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ripe Tomato Preserves.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>7 lbs. round yellow, or egg tomatoes—<i>peeled</i>.</li>
<li>7 lbs. sugar, and juice of three lemons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let them stand together over night. Drain off the syrup
and boil it, skimming well. Put in the tomatoes and boil
gently twenty minutes. Take out the fruit with a perforated
skimmer, and spread upon dishes. Boil the syrup
down until it thickens, adding, just before you take it up,
the juice of three lemons. Put the fruit into the jars and
fill up with hot syrup. When cold, seal or tie up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Tomato Preserves.</span> (<i>Good.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>8 lbs. small green tomatoes. Pierce each with a fork.</li>
<li>7 lbs. sugar.</li>
<li>4 lemons—the juice only.</li>
<li>1 oz. ginger and mace mixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat all together slowly, and boil until the fruit is
clear. Take it from the kettle in a perforated skimmer,
and spread upon dishes to cool. Boil the syrup thick.
Put the fruit into jars and cover with hot syrup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Figs.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>The weight of ripe figs in sugar.</li>
<li>Peel of one lemon and juice of two.</li>
<li>A little ginger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the figs with cold water for twelve hours. Then
simmer in water enough to cover them until tender, and
spread out upon a sieve to cool and harden. Make a
syrup of the sugar, and a cup of cold water for every
pound. Boil until clear of scum; put in the figs and
simmer ten minutes. Take them out and spread upon
dishes in the sun. Add the lemons and ginger; boil the
syrup thick; give the figs another boil of fifteen minutes,
and fill the jars three-quarters of the way to the top. Fill
up with boiling syrup, cover, and, when cold, seal up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apples.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut out the blossom end of sweet apples—Campfields
or Pound Sweets—with a sharp penknife; wash, but do
not pare them; pack them in a large pudding-dish; pour
a cupful of water in the bottom, cover closely with another
dish or pan; set in a moderate oven, and steam until tender
all through. Pour the liquor over them while hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
and repeat this as they cool. Set on the ice several hours
before tea, and, when you are ready, transfer them to
a glass dish, pouring the juice over them again. Eat
with powdered sugar and cream. Apples baked in this
way are more tender and digestible, and better flavored,
than those baked in an open vessel. Campfields are
particularly good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples Stewed Whole.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, and with a small knife extract the cores of fine
juicy apples that are not too tart; put into a deep dish
with just enough water to cover them; cover and bake, or
stew, in a moderate oven, until they are tender and clear;
take out the apples, put in a bowl, and cover to keep hot;
put the juice into a saucepan, with a cupful of sugar for
twelve apples, and boil half an hour. Season with mace,
ginger, or whole cloves, adding the spice ten minutes before
you remove the syrup from the fire. Pour scalding
over the apples, and cover until cold.</p>

<p>Eat with cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Sweet pears may be baked just as sweet apples are—<i>i.
e.</i>, steamed without being pared or cored.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If large, cut in half, put into a deep dish, with a very
little water; sprinkle them with sugar, and put a few
cloves, or bits of cinnamon, or a pinch of ginger among
them. Cover closely, and bake until tender.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pears.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>If small and ripe, cut out the blossom-end, without
paring or coring; put into a saucepan, with enough water
to cover them, and stew until tender; add a half cupful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
of sugar for every quart of pears, and stew all together
ten minutes; take out the pears, lay in a covered bowl to
keep warm; add to the syrup a little ginger or a few
cloves, boil fifteen minutes longer, and pour over the
fruit hot.</p>


<h3><i>Or,</i></h3>

<p class='unindent'>If the pears are not quite ripe, but hard and disposed to
be tough, peel them, cut out the blossom-end, leaving on
the stems, and stew until tender in enough water to cover
them. Take them out, set by in a covered dish to keep
warm; add to the liquor in the saucepan an equal quantity
of the best molasses and a little ginger; boil half an
hour, skim, and return the pears to the saucepan. Stew
all together twenty minutes, and pour out.</p>

<p>These are very good, and will keep a week or more,
even in warm weather. I have canned them while boiling
hot, and kept them sweet a whole year.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Quinces.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and quarter; extract the seeds and stew the fruit
in clear water until a straw will pierce them; put into a
baking-dish with a half cupful of sugar to every eight
quinces; pour over them the liquor in which they were
boiled; cover closely, and steam in the oven one hour;
take out the quinces, lay them in a covered bowl to keep
warm; return the syrup to the saucepan, and boil twenty
minutes; pour over the quinces, and set away covered, to
cool. Eat cold.</p>



<h3>FRUIT JELLIES.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant, Blackberry, Strawberry, etc.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Put the fruit into a stone jar; set this in a kettle of
tepid water, and put it upon the fire. Let it boil, closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
covered, until the fruit is broken to pieces; strain, pressing
the bag (a stout coarse one) hard, putting in but a
few handfuls at a time, and between each squeezing turning
it inside out to scald off the pulp and skins. To each
pint of juice allow a pound of sugar. Set the juice on
alone to boil, and while it is warming divide the sugar
into several different portions, and put into shallow pie-dishes
or pans that will fit in your ovens; heat in these,
opening the ovens now and then to stir it and prevent
burning. Boil the juice just <i>twenty minutes</i> from the moment
it begins fairly to boil. By this time the sugar should
be so hot you cannot bear your hand in it. Should it melt
around the edges, do not be alarmed. The burned parts
will only form into lumps in the syrup, and can easily be
taken out. Throw the sugar into the boiling juice, stirring
rapidly all the while. It will “hiss” as it falls in, and
melt very quickly. Withdraw your spoon when you are
sure it is dissolved. Let the jelly just come to a boil, to
make all certain, and take the kettle instantly from the
fire. Roll your glasses or cups in hot water, and fill with
the scalding liquid. If these directions be strictly followed,
and the fruit is at the proper state of ripeness,
there need be no dread of failure. I have often had the
jelly “form” before I filled the last glass.</p>

<p>I wish it were in my power, by making known the advantages
of the process I have described, to put an end to
the doubts and anxieties attendant upon the old-fashioned
method of boiling jelly into a preserve. This plan is so
simple and safe, the jelly made so superior in flavor and
color to that produced by boiling down juice and fruit,
that no one who has ever tried both ways can hesitate to
give it the preference. I have put up jelly in no other
way for eighteen years, and have never failed once.</p>

<p>Strawberry jelly should have a little lemon-juice added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
to that of the fruit. Both it and blackberry, and very
ripe raspberry jelly, are apt to be less firm than that made
from more tart fruits; still, do not boil it. Set it in the
sun, as I have directed at the beginning of the section
upon preserves and fruit jellies, filling one cup from another
as the contents shrink. The sun will boil it down with
less waste, and less injury to color and taste, than the fire
will. Cooking jelly always darkens it.</p>

<p>Put brandied tissue-paper over the top of each glass
when cold and firm, paste a thick paper over it, and keep
in a dry place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry and Currant Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>To two parts red raspberries or “Blackcaps,” put one
of red currants, and proceed as with other berry jelly.</p>

<p>The flavor is exquisite. This jelly is especially nice for
cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Cherry and Currant Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Two-thirds wild cherries (stones and all) and one of red
currants. A pound of sugar to a pint of juice, and make
as you do plain currant jelly.</p>

<p>This, besides being very palatable and an excellent table
jelly, is highly medicinal, good for coughs and any
weakness of the digestive organs. I put it up first as an
experiment, and because I chanced to have the cherries.
Now I would not pass the winter without it, unless obliged
to do so by a failure of the fruit crop.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Crack one-third of the kernels and put them in the jar
with the peaches, which should be pared, stoned, and
sliced. Heat in a pot of boiling water, stirring from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
to time until the fruit is well broken. Strain, and to
every pint of peach juice add the juice of a lemon. Measure
again, allowing a pound of sugar to a pint of liquid.
Heat the sugar very hot, and add when the juice has
boiled twenty minutes. Let it come to a boil, and take
instantly from the fire.</p>

<p>This is very fine for jelly-cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Fox Grape Jelly</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made after the receipt for currant jelly, only allowing a
pound and a half of sugar to a pint of juice.</p>

<p>Ripe grapes require but pound for pint.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quince Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare and slice the quinces, and add for every five pounds
of fruit a cup of water. Put peelings, cores, and all into
a stone jar; set this in a pot of boiling water, and, when
the fruit is soft and broken, proceed as with other jellies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crab-apple Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Cut Siberian crab-apples to pieces, but do not pare or
remove the seeds. The latter impart a peculiarly pleasant
flavor to the fruit. Put into a stone jar, set in a pot
of hot water, and let it boil eight or nine hours. Leave in
the jar all night, covered closely. Next morning, squeeze
out the juice, allow pound for pint, and manage as you do
currant jelly.</p>

<p>Should the apples be very dry, add a cup of water for
every six pounds of fruit.</p>

<p>There is no finer jelly than this in appearance and in
taste.</p>

<h2>CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.</h2>


<p>Within a few years canned fruits have, in a great
measure, superseded preserves. They are cheaper, more
wholesome, and far less difficult to prepare. Attention to
a few general rules will insure success to every housekeeper
who sensibly prefers to put up her own season’s
supply of these to purchasing those for double the cost,
which are not nearly so good.</p>

<p>First, examine cans and elastics narrowly before you
begin operations. See that the screw is in order, the can
without crack or nick, the elastic firm and closely fitting.</p>

<p>Secondly, have the fruit boiling hot when sealed. Have
upon the range or stove a pan in which each empty can is
set to be filled after it is rolled in hot water. Lay elastic
and top close to your hand, fill the can to overflowing, remembering
that the fruit will shrink as it cools, and that
a vacuum invites the air to enter; clap on the top without
the loss of a second, screw as tightly as you can, and as the
contents and the can cool, screw again and again to fit the
contraction of metal and glass.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if you use glass cans (and they are cheapest in
the end, for you can use them year after year, getting new
elastics when you need them) keep them in a cool, dark
place, and dry as well as cool. The light will cause them
to ferment, and also change the color.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Berries.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Heat slowly to boiling, in a large kettle. When they
begin to boil, add sugar in the proportion of one tablespoonful
to each quart of fruit. Before doing this, however,
if there is much juice in the kettle, dip out the surplus
with a dipper or cup. It will only increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
number of cans to be filled, without real advantage to you.
Leave the berries almost dry before putting in the sugar.
This will make syrup enough. Boil all together fifteen
minutes, and can.</p>

<p>Huckleberries, grapes, blackberries, currants, raspberries,
cherries, and strawberries put up in this way are very
good, eaten as you would preserves, and make pies which
are scarcely inferior to those filled with fresh fruit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Peaches.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pare, cut in half and stone, taking care not to break
the fruit; drop each piece in cold water so soon as it is
pared. The large, white freestone peaches are nicest for
this purpose. Firmness of texture is a desideratum. The
fruit should be ripe, but not soft. Allow a heaping tablespoonful
of sugar to each quart of fruit, scattering it
between the layers. Fill your kettle and heat slowly to a
boil. Boil three minutes, just to assure yourself that every
piece of fruit is heated through. Can and seal. It is
safe to put a cupful of water in the bottom of the kettle
before packing it with fruit, lest the lower layer should
burn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Pears.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>For the finer varieties, such as the Bartlett and Seckel,
prepare a syrup, allowing a pint of pure water and a quarter
of a pound of sugar to a quart of fruit. While this is
heating, peel the pears, dropping each, as it is pared, into
a pan of clear water, lest the color should change by exposure
to the air. When the syrup has come to a fast
boil, put in the pears carefully, not to bruise them, and
boil until they look clear and can be easily pierced by a
fork. Have the cans ready, rolled in hot water, pack
with the pears and fill to overflowing with the scalding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
syrup, which must be kept on the fire all the while, and
seal.</p>

<p>The tougher and more common pears must be boiled in
water until tender; thrown while warm into the hot syrup,
then allowed to boil ten minutes before they are canned.</p>

<p>Apples may be treated in either of the above ways as
their texture may seem to demand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Plums.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Prick with a needle to prevent bursting; prepare a
syrup allowing a gill of pure water and a quarter of a
pound of sugar to every three quarts of fruit. When the
sugar is dissolved and the water blood-warm, put in the
plums. Heat slowly to a boil. Let them boil five minutes—not
fast or they will break badly, fill up the jars with
plums, pour in the scalding syrup until it runs down the
sides, and seal.</p>

<p>Greengages are very fine put up in this way; also damsons
for pies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Tomatoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>“I don’t hold with any of these new-fangled notions,”
said an old lady to me, when I mentioned that my canning
was over for the summer. “I was beguiled, two years ago,
into putting up some <i>tomaytesses</i> in cans, and if I’m forgiven
for that folly I’ll never tempt Providence in the
same manner again.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t keep, then?”</p>

<p>“Keep! they sp’iled in a week! ’Twas no more’n I
expected and deserved for meddling with such a humbug.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you did not follow the directions closely?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did! I cooked the tormented things, and
seasoned ’em with butter and salt, all ready for the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
and screwed the tops down tight. But, in course, they
sp’iled!”</p>

<p>“Were you careful to put them into the cans boiling
hot?”</p>

<p>“’Twould have cracked the glass! I let ’em get <i>nice
and cold</i> first. I didn’t suppose it made any difference
about such a trifle as that!”</p>

<p>Poor old lady! I think of her and her mighty temptation
of Providence whenever I can tomatoes, for heat <i>does</i>
make a difference—all the difference in the world in this
sort of work.</p>

<p>Pour boiling water over the tomatoes to loosen the
skins. Remove these; drain off all the juice that will
come away without pressing hard; put them into a kettle
and heat slowly to a boil. Your tomatoes will look much
nicer if you remove all the hard parts before putting
them on the fire, and rub the pulp soft with your hands.
Boil ten minutes, dip out the surplus liquid, pour the
tomatoes, boiling hot, into the cans, and seal. Keep in a
cool, dark place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Tomatoes and Corn.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil the corn on the cob, when it is in nice order for
roasting, twenty minutes over a good fire, and cut off
while hot. Have your tomatoes skinned and rubbed to
a smooth pulp. Put in two measures of them for every
one of the cut corn; salt as for the table, stirring it well
in, and bring to a hard boil. Then, can quickly, and as

<h3><span class="smcap">Preserved Green Corn.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Boil on the cob until the milk ceases to flow when the
grain is pricked. Cut off the corn and pack in stone jars
in the following order:—A layer of salt at the bottom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
half an inch deep. Then one of corn two inches in depth,
another half-inch of salt, and so on until the jar is nearly
filled. Let the topmost layer of salt be double the depth
of the others, and pour over all melted—not hot—lard.
Press upon this, when nearly hard, thick white paper, cut
to fit the mouth of the jar. Keep in a cool place. Soak
over night before using it.</p>

<p>Green corn is difficult to can, but <i>I know</i> it will keep
well if put up in this way. And, strange to tell, be so
fresh after the night’s soaking as to require salt when you
boil it for the table. Should the top layer be musty, dig
lower still, and you will probably be rewarded for the
search.</p>

<h2>BRANDIED FRUITS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brandied Peaches or Pears.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 lbs. fruit.</li>
<li>4 lbs. sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint best white brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a syrup of the sugar and enough water to dissolve
it. Let this come to a boil; put the fruit in and boil five
minutes. Having removed the fruit carefully, let the
syrup boil fifteen minutes longer, or until it thickens well;
add the brandy, and take the kettle at once from the fire;
pour the hot syrup over the fruit, and seal.</p>

<p>If, after the fruit is taken from the fire, a reddish liquor
oozes from it, drain this off before adding the clear syrup.
Put up in glass jars.</p>

<p>Peaches and pears should be peeled for brandying.
Plums should be pricked and watched carefully for fear
of bursting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brandied Cherries or Berries.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make a syrup of a pound of sugar and a half gill of
water for every two lbs. of fruit. Heat to boiling, stirring
to prevent burning, and pour over the berries while warm—<i>not</i>
hot. Let them stand together an hour; put all into
a preserving-kettle, and heat slowly; boil five minutes,
take out the fruit with a perforated skimmer, and boil the
syrup twenty minutes. Add a pint of brandy for every
five pounds of fruit; pour over the berries hot, and seal.</p>

<h2>CANDIES.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Molasses Candy.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart good molasses.</li>
<li>½ cup vinegar.</li>
<li>1 cup sugar.</li>
<li>Butter the size of an egg.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful saleratus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, mix with the molasses,
and boil, stirring frequently, until it hardens when
dropped from the spoon into cold water; then stir in the
butter and soda, the latter dissolved in hot water. Flavor
to your taste, give one hard final stir, and pour into buttered
dishes. As it cools, cut into squares for “taffy,” or,
while soft enough to handle, pull white into sticks, using
only the buttered tips of your fingers for that purpose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sugar-candy.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 cups of sugar.</li>

<h2>PICKLES.</h2>


<p>Use none but the best cider vinegar; especially avoid
the sharp colorless liquid sold under that name. It is
weak sulphuric acid, warranted to riddle the coat of any
stomach, even that of an ostrich, if that bird were so bereft
of the instinct of self-preservation as to make a lunch of
bright-green cucumber-pickle seven times a week.</p>

<p>If you boil pickles in bell-metal, do not let them stand
in it one moment when it is off the fire; and see for yourself
that it is perfectly clean and newly scoured before the
vinegar is put in.</p>

<p>Keep pickles in glass or hard stoneware; look them
over every month; remove the soft ones, and if there are
several of these, drain off and scald the vinegar, adding a
cup of sugar for each gallon, and pour hot over the pickles.
If they are keeping well, throw in a liberal handful of
sugar for every gallon, and tie them up again. This tends
to preserve them, and mellows the sharpness of the vinegar.
This does not apply to <i>sweet</i> pickle.</p>

<p>Pickle, well made, is better when a year old than at the
end of six months. I have eaten walnut pickle ten years
old that was very fine.</p>

<p>Keep your pickles well covered with vinegar.</p>

<p>If you use ground spices, tie them up in thin muslin
bags.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cucumber or Gherkin Pickle.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Choose small cucumbers, or gherkins, for this purpose.
They are more tender, and look better on the table. Reject
all over a finger in length, and every one that is misshapen
or specked, however slightly. Pack in a stone jar
or wooden bucket, in layers, strewing salt thickly between
these. Cover the top layer out of sight with salt, and
pour on cold water enough to cover all. Lay a small
plate or round board upon them, with a clean stone to
keep it down. You may leave them in the brine for a
week or a month, stirring up from the bottom every other
day. If the longer time, be sure your salt and water is
strong enough to bear up an egg. If you raise your own
cucumbers, pick them every day, and drop in the pickle.
When you are ready to put them up, throw away the
brine, with any cucumbers that may have softened under
the process, and lay the rest in cold fresh water for twenty-four
hours. Change the water then for fresh, and leave
it for another day. Have a kettle ready, lined with green
vine-leaves, and lay the pickles evenly within it, scattering
powdered alum over the layers. A bit of alum as large
as a pigeon-egg will be enough for a two-gallon kettleful.
Fill with cold water, cover with vine-leaves, three deep;
put a close lid or inverted pan over all, and steam over a
slow fire five or six hours, not allowing the water to boil.
When the pickles are a fine green, remove the leaves and
throw the cucumbers into very cold water. Let them
stand in it while you prepare the vinegar. To one gallon
allow a cup of sugar, three dozen whole black peppers, the
same of cloves, half as much allspice, one dozen blades of
mace. Boil five minutes; put the cucumbers into a stone
jar, and pour the vinegar over them scalding hot. Cover
closely. Two days afterward scald the vinegar again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
return to the pickles. Repeat this process three times
more, at intervals of two, four, and six days. Cover with
a stoneware or wooden top; tie stout cloth over this, and
keep in a cool, dry place. They will be ready for eating
in two months. Examine every few weeks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Mangoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Young musk or nutmeg melons.</li>
<li>English mustard-seed two handfuls, mixed with</li>
<li>Scraped horseradish, one handful.</li>
<li>Mace and nutmeg pounded, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Chopped garlic, 2 teaspoonfuls.</li>
<li>A little ginger.</li>
<li>Whole pepper-corns, 1 dozen.</li>
<li>½ tablespoonful of ground mustard to a pint of the mixture.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful sugar to the same quantity.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful best salad oil to the same.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful celery-seed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut a slit in the side of the melon; insert your finger
and extract all the seeds. If you cannot get them out in
this way, cut a slender piece out, saving it to replace,—but
the slit is better. Lay the mangoes in strong brine
for three days. Drain off the brine, and freshen in pure
water twenty-four hours. Green as you would cucumbers,
and lay in cold water until cold and firm. Fill with the
stuffing; sew up the slit, or tie up with pack thread; pack
in a deep stone jar, and pour scalding vinegar over them.
Repeat this process three times more at intervals of two
days, then tie up and set away in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>They will not be “ripe” under four months, but are
very fine when they are. They will keep several years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pepper Mangoes.</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are put up in the same way, using green peppers that
are full grown, but not tinged with red.</p>

<p>They are very good, but your fingers will smart after
thrusting them into the peppers to pull out the seeds. For
this purpose I have used, first, a small penknife, to cut the
core from its attachment to the stem-end of the pepper,
then a smooth bit of stick, to pry open the slit in the side
and work out the loose core or bunch of seed. By the
exercise of a little ingenuity you may spare yourself all
suffering from this cause. Should your fingers burn badly,
anoint them with sweet-oil and wear gloves that night.
Cream will also allay the smart.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Cabbage</span> (<i>Yellow.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 gallons vinegar.</li>
<li>1 pint white mustard seed. }</li>
<li>4 oz. ginger.              }</li>
<li>3 oz. pepper-corns.        }</li>
<li>1 oz. allspice.            } pounded fine.</li>
<li>2 oz. cloves.              }</li>
<li>1 oz. mace.                }</li>
<li>1 oz. nutmeg.              }</li>
<li>2 oz. turmeric.            }</li>
<li>1 large handful of garlic, chopped.</li>
<li>1 handful scraped horseradish.</li>
<li>4 lbs. sugar.</li>
<li>2 oz. celery seed.</li>
<li>3 lemons, sliced thin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all and set in the sun for three days.</p>

<p>To prepare the cabbage, cut in quarters—leaving off
the outer and green leaves—and put in a kettle of boiling
brine. Cook three minutes. Take out, drain, and cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
thickly with salt. Spread out in the sun to dry; then
shake off the salt, and cover with cold vinegar in which
has been steeped enough turmeric to color it well. Leave
it in this two weeks, to draw out the salt and to plump the
cabbage. They are then ready to pack down in the seasoned
vinegar. Do not use under six weeks or two months.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Cabbage</span> (<i>Purple.</i>)</h3>

<p>Quarter the cabbage. Lay in a wooden tray, sprinkle
thickly with salt, and set in the cellar until next day.
Drain off the brine, wipe dry, lay in the sun two hours,
and cover with cold vinegar for twelve hours. Prepare
the pickle by seasoning enough vinegar to cover the cabbage
with equal quantities of mace, cloves, whole white
peppers; a cup of sugar to every gallon of vinegar, and a
teaspoonful of celery seed for every pint. Pack the cabbage
in a stone jar; boil the vinegar and spices five minutes
and pour on hot. Cover and set away in a cool, dry
place.</p>

<p>This will be ripe in six weeks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Peel the onions, which should be fine white ones—not
<i>too</i> large. Let them stand in strong brine for four days,
changing it twice. Heat more brine to a boil, throw in
the onions, and boil three minutes. Throw them at once
into cold water, and leave them there four hours. Pack
in jars, interspersing with whole mace, white pepper-corns,
and cloves. Fill up with scalding vinegar in which you
have put a cupful of sugar for every gallon. Cork while
hot.</p>

<p>They will be ready for use in a month, but will be
better at the end of three months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Beans and Radish Pods.</span></h3>

<p>Take young French or “string” beans, and radish pods
just before they change color; green and pickle as you do
cucumbers and gherkins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nasturtium-seed.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Take the green seed after the flower has dried off. Lay
in salt and water two days, in cold water one day; pack
in bottles and cover with scalding vinegar, seasoned with
mace and white pepper-corns, and sweetened slightly with
white sugar. Cork, and set away four weeks before you
use them.</p>

<p>They are an excellent substitute for capers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Butternuts and Walnuts.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Gather them when soft enough to be pierced by a pin.
Lay them in strong brine five days, changing this twice
in the meantime. Drain, and wipe them with a coarse
cloth; pierce each by running a large needle through it,
and lay in cold water for six hours.</p>

<p>To each gallon of vinegar allow a cup of sugar, three
dozen each of whole cloves and black pepper-corns, half
as much allspice, and a dozen blades of mace. Boil five
minutes; pack the nuts in small jars and pour over them
scalding hot. Repeat this twice within a week; tie up
and set away.</p>

<p>They will be good to eat in a month—and very good too.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Cauliflower.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Pick the whitest and closest bunches. Cut into small
sprays or clusters. Plunge into a kettle of scalding brine
and boil three minutes. Take them out, lay upon a sieve
or a cloth, sprinkle thickly with salt, and, when dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
brush this off. Cover with cold vinegar for two days,
setting the jar in the sun. Then pack carefully in glass
or stoneware jars, and pour over them scalding vinegar
seasoned thus:</p>

<p>To one gallon allow a cup of white sugar, a dozen
blades of mace, a tablespoonful of celery-seed, two dozen
white peppercorns and some bits of red pepper pods, a
tablespoonful of coriander-seed, and the same of whole
mustard. Boil five minutes. Repeat the scalding once a
week for three weeks; tie up and set away. Keep the
cauliflowers under the vinegar by putting a small plate
on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sliced Cucumber Pickle.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 dozen large cucumbers, sliced, and boiled in vinegar enough to cover them, one hour. Set aside in the hot vinegar.</li>
<li>To each gallon of cold vinegar allow—</li>
<li>1 lb. sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful ginger.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful black pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful celery-seed.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of mace.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful allspice.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful cloves.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful turmeric.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful horseradish, scraped.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful garlic, sliced.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cayenne pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put in the cucumbers and stew two hours.</p>

<p>The pickle will be ready for use so soon as it is cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pickled Water-melon Rind.</span> (<i>Extremely nice.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Equal weight of rind and white sugar.</li>
<li>½ ounce white ginger to a gallon of pickle.</li>
<li>1 pint vinegar to every pound of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful turmeric to a gallon of pickle.</li>
<li>Mace, cloves, and cinnamon to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the thickest rind you can get, pare off the hard
green rind, also the soft inner pulp. Lay the pieces—narrow
strips or fanciful cuttings—in brine strong enough
to float an egg, and let them remain in it ten days. Then
soak in fair water, changing it every day for ten days.
Cover them with clear water in a preserving-kettle, heat
slowly and boil five minutes. Take them out and plunge
instantly into ice-water. Leave them in this until next
day. Give them another gentle boil of five minutes in
strong alum-water. Simmer carefully, as a hard boil will
injure them. Change <i>directly</i> from the alum to the ice-water
again, and do not disturb them for four hours. After
a third boil of five minutes, let them remain all night
in the last water to make them tender. Next day add to
enough water to cover the rinds sufficient sugar to make
it quite sweet, but not a syrup. Simmer the rinds in this
ten minutes, throw the water away, and spread them upon
dishes to cool. Meanwhile prepare a second syrup, allowing
sugar equal in weight to the rind, and half an
ounce of sliced white ginger to a gallon of the pickle,
with a cup of water for every two pounds of sugar. When
the sugar is melted and the syrup quite hot, but not boiling,
put in the rinds and simmer until they look quite
clear. Take it out, spread upon the dishes again, while
you add to the syrup a pint of vinegar for every pound
of the sugar you have put in, one tablespoonful of turmeric
to a gallon of pickle; mace, cloves and cinnamon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
taste. Boil this up, return the rind to it, and simmer
fifteen minutes. Put up in glass jars. It will be fit for
use in two weeks.</p>

<p>This is a very handsome and delicious pickle, although
it may seem to be made upon the principle of the Frenchman’s
pebble-soup.</p>

<h2>DRINKS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>Never buy the ground coffee put up in packages, if you
can get any other. The mere fact that after they have
gone to the expense of the machinery and labor requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
for grinding it, the manufacturers can sell it cheaper per
pound than grocers can the whole grains, roasted or raw,
should convince every sensible person that it is adulterated
with other and less expensive substances. Be that as it
may, coffee loses its aroma so rapidly after it is ground
that it is worth your while to buy it whole, either in small
quantities freshly roasted, or raw, and roast it yourself;
or stand by and see your respectable grocer grind what
you have just bought. You can roast in a pan in the oven,
stirring every few minutes, or in the same upon the top of
the range. Stir often and roast quickly to a bright brown—not
a dull black. While still hot, beat up the white of
an egg with a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir up
well with it. This will tend to preserve the flavor. Grind
just enough at a time for a single making.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To make Coffee</span> (<i>boiled.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 full coffee-cup (½ pint) of ground coffee.</li>

<p>Stir up the eggshell and the white (beaten) with the
coffee, and a very little cold water, and mix gradually
with the boiling water in the coffee-boiler. Stir from the
sides and top as it boils up. Boil pretty fast twelve minutes;
pour in the cold water and take from the fire, setting
gently upon the hearth to settle. In five minutes,
pour it off carefully into your silver, china, or Britannia
coffee-pot, which should be previously well scalded.</p>

<p>Send to table <i>hot</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To make Coffee without Boiling.</span></h3>

<p>There are so many patent coffee-pots for this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
and the directions sold with these are so minute, that I
need give only a few general rules here. Allow rather
more coffee to a given quantity of water than if it were to
be boiled, and have it ground <i>very</i> fine. Put the coffee in
the uppermost compartment, pour on the water very slowly
until the fine coffee is saturated, then more rapidly. The
water should be boiling. Shut down the top, and the coffee
ought to be ready when it has gone through the double
or treble set of strainers. Should it not be strong enough,
run it through again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Café au Lait.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint very strong <i>made</i> coffee—fresh and hot.</li>
<li>1 pint boiling milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>The coffee should be poured off the grounds through a
fine strainer (thin muslin is the best material) into the
table coffee-pot. Add the milk, and set the pot where it
will keep hot for five minutes before pouring it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of tea to one <i>large</i> cupful of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the teapot well, put in the tea, and, covering close,
set it on the stove or range one minute to warm; pour on
enough boiling water to cover it well, and let it stand ten
minutes to “draw.” Keep the lid of the pot shut, and
set in a warm place, but do not let it boil. Fill up with
as much boiling water as you will need, and send hot to
the table, after pouring into a heated china or silver pot.</p>

<p>The bane of tea in many households is unboiled water.
It can never extract the flavor as it should, although it
steep for hours. The kettle should not only steam, but
bubble and puff in a hard boil before you add water from
it to the tea-leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>Boiling after the tea is made, injures the flavor either
by deadening or making it rank and “herby.”</p>

<p>The English custom of making tea upon the breakfast
or tea-table is fast gaining ground in America. It is at
once the best and prettiest way of preparing the beverage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls grated chocolate to each pint of water.</li>
<li>As much milk as you have water.</li>
<li>Sweeten to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the water boiling hot. Rub the chocolate
smooth in a little cold water, and stir into the boiling water.
Boil twenty minutes; add the milk and boil ten minutes
more, stirring frequently. You can sweeten upon the
fire or in the cups.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa Nibs, or Shells.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of boiling water.</li>
<li>2 ozs. of cocoa nibs.</li>
<li>1 quart fresh milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wet the shells or nibs up with a little cold water; add
to the boiling, and cook one hour and a half; strain, put
in the milk, let it heat almost to boiling, and take from
the fire.</p>

<p>This is excellent for invalids.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry Royal.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 quarts ripe berries.</li>
<li>1 quart best cider vinegar.</li>
<li>1 lb. white sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint fine brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the berries in a stone jar, pour the vinegar over
them, add the sugar, and pound the berries to a paste with
a wooden pestle, or mash with a spoon. Let them stand
in the sun four hours; strain and squeeze out all the juice,
and put in the brandy. Seal up in bottles; lay them on
their sides in the cellar, and cover with sawdust.</p>

<p>Stir two tablespoonfuls into a tumbler of ice-water when
you wish to use it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry Vinegar.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Put the raspberries into a stone vessel and mash them
to a pulp. Add cider-vinegar—no specious imitation,
but the genuine article—enough to cover it well. Stand
in the sun twelve hours, and all night in the cellar. Stir up
well occasionally during this time. Strain, and put as
many fresh berries in the jar as you took out; pour the
strained vinegar over them; mash and set in the sun all
day. Strain a second time next day. To each quart of
this juice allow</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 pint of water.</li>
<li>5 lbs. of sugar (best white) for every 3 pints of this liquid, juice and water mingled.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>Place over a gentle fire and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
Heat slowly to boiling, skimming off the scum,
and as soon as it fairly boils take off and strain. Bottle
while warm, and seal the corks with sealing wax, or bees’-wax
and rosin.</p>

<p>A most refreshing and pleasant drink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackberry Vinegar</span></h3>

<li>1 lb. white sugar.</li>
<li>½ oz. grated nutmeg.</li>
<li>½ oz. powdered cinnamon.</li>
<li>¼ oz. allspice.</li>
<li>¼ oz. cloves.</li>

jar, with a cloth thrown lightly over it. When it has
done fermenting, rack it off carefully, not to disturb the
lees. Bottle and cork down well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Wine.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Mash ripe berries to a pulp; put into a stone jar.</li>
<li>Add 1 quart of water to 2 quarts of berries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir well and let it stand two days. Strain through a

in quantity to the first, and cover with this liquid. Steep
two days more; strain; add</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. sugar for 3 quarts of liquor,</li>
</ul>

<p>and boil five minutes. Let it ferment in lightly covered
jars; rack off and bottle.</p>

<p>This is said to be very good for scrofula.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Wine.</span></h3>

<p>3 quarts of strawberries, mashed and strained. To the
juice (there should be about a quart, if the berries are ripe
and fresh) add</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart of water.</li>
<li>1 lb. of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir up well and ferment in a clean, sweet cask, leaving

off when it is quite still, and bottle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jamaica Ginger-beer.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 bottle Jamaica Ginger Extract.</li>
<li>1 oz. cream-tartar.</li>
<li>6 quarts water.</li>
<li>1 lb. sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir until the sugar is melted, then put in the grated
peel of a lemon, and heat until blood-warm. Add a tablespoonful
of brewers’ yeast; stir well and bottle, wiring

<h3><span class="smcap">Lemonade or Sherbet.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 lemons to a quart of water.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pare the yellow peel from the lemons, and, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
mean to use the Sherbet immediately, leave it out. It
gives a bitter taste to the sugar if left long in it. Slice
and squeeze the lemons upon the sugar, add a very little
water, and let them stand fifteen minutes. Then fill up
with water; ice well, stir, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orangeade</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made in the same manner, substituting oranges for
lemons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Sherbet.</span> (<i>Delicious.</i>) ✠</h3>

sugar, squeezing the cloth hard; stir until the sugar is
dissolved; strain again and set in ice for two hours or
more before you use it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Regent’s Punch.</span> (<i>Fine.</i>)</h3>

<li>1 lb. loaf-sugar or rock candy.</li>
<li>1 large cup strong black tea—(made).</li>
<li>3 wineglasses of brandy.</li>
<li>3 wineglasses of rum.</li>
<li>1 bottle champagne.</li>
<li>2 oranges—juice only.</li>
<li>3 lemons—juice only.</li>
<li>1 large lump of ice.</li>
</ul>

<p>This receipt was given me by a gentleman of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
school, a connoisseur in the matter of beverages as of
cookery. “Tell your readers,” he writes, “that better
punch was never brewed.” I give receipt and message
together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roman Punch.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>3 coffee cups of lemonade—(strong and sweet.)</li>
<li>1 glass champagne.</li>
<li>1 glass rum.</li>
<li>2 oranges—juice only.</li>
<li>2 eggs—whites only—well whipped.</li>
<li>½ lb. powdered sugar, beaten into the stiffened whites.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ice abundantly—or, if you prefer, freeze.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sherry Cobbler.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Several slices of pineapple, cut in quarters.</li>
<li>A lemon, sliced thin.</li>
<li>An orange, sliced thin.</li>
<li>½ cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 tumbler of Sherry wine.</li>
<li>Ice-water.</li>
<li>Pounded ice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a wide-mouthed quart pitcher and lay the sliced
fruit in order at the bottom, sprinkling sugar and pounded
ice between the layers. Cover with sugar and ice, and
let all stand together five minutes. Add then two tumblers
of water and all the sugar, and stir well to dissolve
this. Fill the pitcher nearly full of pounded ice, pour in
the wine, and stir up from the bottom until the ingredients
are thoroughly mixed. In pouring it out put a
slice of each kind of fruit in each goblet before adding
the liquid.</p>

<p>It is best sucked through a straw or glass tube.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nectar.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Make as above, substituting a little rose-water for the
pineapple, and squeezing out the juice of the orange and
lemon, instead of putting in the slices. Sprinkle nutmeg
on the top.</p>

<p>This forms a delicious and refreshing drink for invalids.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Claret Punch.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 bottle of claret.</li>
<li>¼ the quantity of ice-water.</li>
<li>2 lemons, sliced.</li>
<li>½ cup powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the sliced lemon with sugar and let it stand ten
minutes. Add the water; stir hard for a whole minute,
and pour in the wine. Put pounded ice in each glass before
filling with the mixture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Nogg.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately and very stiff.</li>
<li>1 quart rich milk.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>½ pint best brandy.</li>
<li>Flavor with nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the yolks into the milk with the sugar, which
should first be beaten with the yolks. Next comes the
brandy. Lastly whip in the whites of three eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Bounce.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 lbs. of sour and the same quantity of sweet cherries.</li>
<li>2½ lbs. white sugar.</li>
<li>1 gallon best whiskey.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crush the cherries to pieces by pounding in a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
wooden vessel with a smooth billet of wood. Beat hard
enough to crack all the stones. Put into a deep stone jar,
mix in the sugar well, and cover with the whiskey. Shake
around briskly and turn into a demijohn. Cork tightly
and let it stand a month, shaking it every day, and another
month without touching it. Then strain off and bottle.</p>

<p>It is better a year than six months old.</p>

<p>If the Maltese cross appears but seldom in the section
devoted to drinks, it is because most of my information
respecting their manufacture is second-hand. In my own
family they are so little used, except in sickness, that I
should not dare to teach others, upon my own authority,
how to prepare them. Indeed, the temptation I felt to
omit many of them reminded me of a remark made, introductory
of preserves, by one of the “Complete Housewives,”
who, all five together, drove me to the verge of an
attack of congestion of the brain, before I had been a
housekeeper for a week. Said this judicious lady:—“Preserves
of all kinds are expensive and indigestible,
and therefore poisonous. <i>Therefore</i>”—again—“I shall
not give directions for their manufacture, except to remark
that barberries stewed in molasses are economical,
and a degree less hurtful than most others of that class of
compounds.”</p>

<p>Then I reflected that I might, upon the same principle,
exclude all receipts in which cocoanut is used, because it
is rank poison to me; while a dear friend of mine would
as soon touch arsenic as an egg. A large majority of the
beverages I have named are highly medicinal, and deserve
a place in the housekeeper’s calendar on that account.
Many, so far from being hurtful, are beneficial to a weak
stomach or a system suffering under general debility.
<i>None which contain alcohol in any shape should be used
daily, much less semi- or tri-daily by a well person.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>This principle reduced to practice would prove the
preventive ounce which would cure, all over the land, the
need for Temperance Societies and Inebriate Asylums.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE SICK-ROOM.</h2>


<p>The sick-chamber should be the most quiet and cheerful
in the house—a sacred isle past which the waves of domestic
toil and solicitude glide silently. This is not an easy
rule to obey. Whoever the invalid may be, whether the
mother, father, or the sweet youngling of the flock, the
foundations of the household seem thrown out of course
while the sickness lasts. You may have good servants
and kind friends to aid you, but the hitch in the machinery
is not to be smoothed out by their efforts. The irregularity
does not annoy you: you do not notice it if the attack be
severe or dangerous. All other thoughts are swallowed
up in the all-absorbing, ever-present alarm. You count
nothing an inconvenience that can bring present relief, or
possible healing to the beloved one; disdain for yourself
rest or ease while the shadow hangs above the pillow
crushed by the helpless head. But when it passes, when
the first transport of thankfulness has subsided into an
abiding sense of safety, the mind swings back to the
accustomed pivot, and your eyes seem to be suddenly unbound.
You find, with dismay, that the children have
run wild, and the comfort of the whole family been
neglected during your confinement to the post of most
urgent duty; with displeasure, that the servants have, as
you consider, taken advantage of your situation to omit
this task, and to slur over that;—in fine, that nothing has
been done well, and so many things left altogether undone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
that you are “worried out of your senses”—a phrase that
too often signifies, out of your temper.</p>

<p>And it is just at this juncture—when you are called to
fifty points of attention and labor at once, and are on the
verge of despair at the conglomeration worse conglomerated
arising before you; fidgetting to pick up dropped stitches
in the web you were wont to keep so even—that the invalid
becomes most exacting. “Unreasonable,” you name
it to yourself, even though it be John himself who calls
upon you every third minute for some little office of loving-kindness;
who wants to be amused and fed and petted,
and made generally comfortable as if he were a six-months-old
baby; who never remembers that you must be wearied
out with watching and anxiety, and that everything below-stairs
is going to destruction for the want of a balance-wheel.
The better he loves you the more apt is he to fancy
that nobody but you can do anything for him; the more
certain to crave something which no one else knows how
to prepare. And when you have strained muscle and
patience a <i>little</i> further to get it ready, and with prudent
foresight made enough to last for several meals, it is more
than probable that his fickle taste will suggest something
entirely different for “next time.” “Just for a change,
you know, dear. One gets so tired of eating the same
thing so often!”</p>

<p>He might be more considerate—less childish—you
think, turning away that he may not see your change of
countenance. When you have taken so much pains to
suit him exactly! It is harder yet when he refuses to
do more than taste the delicacy you hoped would tempt
him.</p>

<p>“It is very nice, I suppose, my love,” says the poor
fellow, with the air of a martyr. “But it does not taste
right, somehow. Maybe the children can dispose of it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
I had a lemon ice, or some wine jelly such as my mother
used to make, I am sure I could relish it. I always did
detest sick peoples’ diet!”</p>

<p>If he is very much shaken as to nerves, he will be likely
to say, “<i>messes</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am fairly wild!” said a loving wife and mother, and
thrifty housekeeper, to me one day, when I called to see
her.</p>

<p>She had just nursed her husband and three children
through the influenza. All had been down with it at
once. That form of demoniacal possession is generally
conducted upon the wholesale principle. One of her servants
had left in disgust at the increased pressure of work;
the weather was rainy, blowy, raw; the streets were muddy,
and there was no such thing as keeping steps and halls
clean, while the four invalids were cross as only toothache
or influenza can make human beings.</p>

<p>“I am fairly wild!” said the worthy creature, with
tears in her eyes. “I cannot snatch a minute, from morning
until night, to put things straight, and yet I am almost
tired to death! I was saying to myself as you came in,
that I wouldn’t try any longer. I would just sit still until
the dirt was piled up to my chin, and <i>then I would get upon
the table!</i>”</p>

<p>How often I have thought of her odd speech since!
sometimes with a smile—more frequently with a sigh.
But with all my pity for the nurse and housekeeper, I
cannot conceal from myself—I would not forget, or let you
forget for a moment—the truth that the sick one is the
greater sufferer. It is never pleasant to be laid upon the
shelf. The resting-place—falsely so-called—is hard and
narrow and uneven enough, even when the tramp of the
outer world does not jar the sore and jaded frame; when
there is no apparent need for the sick person to be upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
his feet, and for aught that others can see, or he can say,
he might just as well stay where he is for a month or two.
But when, the rack of pain having been removed, the
dulled perceptions of the mind re-awaken to sensitiveness,
and there comes to his ear the bugle-call of duty—sharp,
imperative;—when every idle moment speaks to him of a
slain opportunity, and the no longer strong man shakes
his fetters with piteous cries against fate, do not despise, or
be impatient with him. He is feverish and inconsiderate
and capricious because he is not himself. You see only
the poor wreck left by the demon as he tore his way out
of him at the Divine command. Gather it up lovingly in
your arms, and nurse it back to strength and comeliness.
The sick should always be the chief object of thought and
care with all in the household.’ If need be, let the dirt lie
chin-deep everywhere else, so long as it is kept out of that
one room. There be jealous in your care that nothing
offends sight and smell.</p>

<p>There should be <i>no</i> smell in a sick-chamber. To avoid
this, let in the air freely and often. Cologne-water will
not dispel a foul odor, while disinfectants are noisome in
themselves. Bathe the patient as frequently and thoroughly
as prudence will allow, and change his clothing,
with the bed-linen, every day. Do not keep the medicines
where he can see them, nor ever let him witness the mixing
of that which he is to swallow. So soon as his meals
are over, remove every vestige of them from the room.
Even a soiled spoon, lying on table or bureau, may offend
his fastidious appetite. Cover the stand or waiter from
which he eats with a spotless napkin, and serve his food in
your daintiest ware.</p>

<p>My heart softens almost to tearfulness when I recall the
hours, days, weeks, I have myself spent in the chamber of
languishing, and the ingenuity of tenderness that, from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
babyhood, has striven to cheat the imprisonment of weariness,
and make me forget pain and uselessness. The
pretty surprises daily invented for my entertainment; the
exceeding nicety with which they were set out before me;
the loving words that nourished my spirit when the body
was faint unto death,—these are events, not slight incidents,
in the book of memory. When I cease to be grateful
for them, or to learn from them how to minister unto
others of the like consolation, may my heart forget to beat,
my right hand lose her cunning!</p>

<p>Do not ask your charge what he would like to eat to-day.
He will, of a surety, sicken with the effort at selection,
and say, “Nothing!” But watch attentively for the
slightest intimation of a desire for any particular delicacy,
and if you are assured that it cannot hurt him, procure it,
if you can, without letting him guess at your intention.
Feed him lightly and often, never bringing more into his
sight than he may safely eat. A big bowl of broth or jelly
will either tempt him to imprudence, or discourage him.
“Am I to be burdened with all that?” cries the affrighted
stomach, and will have none of it. While he is very
weak, feed him with your own hand, playfully, as you
would a child, talking cheerily of something besides his
food, and coaxing him into taking the needed nutriment
as only a wife and mother can, or as nobody but John
could beguile you to effort in the same direction.</p>

<p>Study all pleasant and soothing arts to while away the
time, and keep worry of every kind away from him. A
trifle at which you can laugh will be a burden to the enfeebled
mind and body, and he has nothing to do but lie
still and roll it over until it swells into a mountain. When
he can be removed without danger, let him have his meals
in another room, changing the air of each when he is not
in it. Every one who has suffered from long sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
knows the peculiar loathing attendant upon the idea that
all food is tainted with the atmosphere of the chamber in
which it is served, and if eaten in bed, tastes of the mattress
and pillows. The room and all in it may be clean,
fresh, and sweet, but the fancy cannot be dismissed. And
it is wiser to humor than to reason with most sick fancies.</p>

<p>A hired nurse is a useful, often a necessary thing, but
while you are upon your feet, and mistress of your own
house, delegate to no one the precious task of catering for
the dear sufferer. It is an art in itself. I hope a practical
knowledge of it will be taught in Women’s Medical Colleges,
when they are an established “institution” with us.</p>

<p>I wish it were proper to record here the name of one of
the kindest and best family physicians I ever knew, who
had charge of my not very firm health during my girlhood.
He owed much—I suppose no one ever knew really how
much—of his success in his practice to his tact and skill
in devising palatable and suitable nourishment for his
patients. I well remember the childish pleasure with
which I would hear him say when the violence of the
attack had passed—“Now, my dear child, we must begin
with kitchen physic!” and the glow of amused expectation
with which I used to watch him, as, with an arch show of
mystery, he would beckon my mother from the room to
receive his “prescription;” the impatience with which I
awaited the result of the conference, and the zest with
which I ate whatever he ordered.</p>

<p>If I could have persuaded him to manage this department
of my work, it would win for me the degree of M.D.
with a new meaning—Mistress of Dietetics.</p>

<h2>THE SICK-ROOM.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Tea.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. <i>lean</i> beef, cut into small pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put into a jar without a drop of water; cover tightly,
and set in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil,
and continue this steadily for three or four hours, until the
meat is like white rags, and the juice all drawn out. Season
with salt to taste, and when cold, skim. The patient
will often prefer this ice-cold to hot. Serve with Albert
biscuit or thin “wafers,” unleavened, made by a receipt
given under the head of <span class="smcap">Bread</span>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Broth.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 lb. lean mutton or lamb, cut small.</li>
<li>1 quart water—cold.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful rice, or barley, soaked in a very little warm water.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls milk.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, with a little chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the meat, unsalted, in the water, keeping it closely
covered, until it falls to pieces. Strain it out, skim, add
the soaked barley or rice; simmer half an hour, stirring
often; stir in the seasoning and the milk, and simmer five
minutes after it heats up well, taking care it does not
burn.</p>

<p>Serve hot with cream crackers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Broth.</span> ✠</h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is excellent made in the same manner as mutton, cracking

<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Sago Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>

<li>1 cup cream, heated to boiling.</li>
<li>Yolks of two eggs, beaten light.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the veal and water in a covered saucepan very
slowly until reduced to one quart of liquid; strain, skim,
season with salt, and stir in the soaked sago (having previously
warmed it by setting for half an hour in a saucepan
of boiling water, and stirring from time to time.)
Simmer half an hour, taking care it does not burn; beat
in the cream and eggs; give one good boil up, and turn
out.</p>

<p>This is excellent for consumptives.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef and Sago Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 lbs. of beef—cut up small.</li>
<li>2 quarts of water.</li>

<li>Yolks of three eggs.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the beef until it falls to pieces; strain it out, salt
the liquid and stir in the sago. Simmer gently one hour,
stirring often. Add the beaten yolks: boil up once and
serve.</p>

<p>This is a strengthening and nice soup. Eat with dry
toast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Jelly</span> (<i>Plain.</i>) ✠</h3>

<li>1 cup <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
<li>2 heaping teaspoonfuls of best Bermuda arrowroot.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful lemon juice.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of white sugar.</li>

<p>Wet the arrowroot in a little cold water, and rub
smooth. Then stir into the hot, which should be on the
fire and actually boiling at the time, with the sugar already
melted in it. Stir until clear, boiling steadily all
the while, and add the lemon. Wet a cup in cold water,
and pour in the jelly to form. Eat cold with sugar and
cream flavored with rose-water.</p>

<p>An invaluable preparation in cases where wine is forbidden.</p>

receipts, when you have soaked it an hour in water
poured over it cold, and gradually warmed by setting the
cup containing it in hot water. Boil rather longer than
you do the arrowroot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sago Gruel.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Put the sago in the water while cold, and warm by
setting in a saucepan of boiling water. Stir often, and let
it soften and heat for one hour. Then <i>boil</i> ten minutes,
stirring all the while; add the sugar, wine, and lemon,
and pour into a bowl or mould to cool. Eat warm, if
preferred. The wine and nutmeg should be omitted if
the patient be feverish.</p>

<p>Wet the meal and flour to a smooth paste, and stir into
the water while it is actually boiling. Boil slowly one
hour, stirring up well from the bottom. Season with salt
to taste. Some sweeten it, but I like it better with a little
pepper added to the salt.</p>

<p>If a cathartic is desired, omit the wheat flour altogether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dried Flour for Teething Children.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup of flour, tied in a stout muslin bag and dropped into cold water, then set over the fire.</li>

<p>Split the crackers, and pile in a bowl in layers, salt

water and set on the hearth, with a close top over the
bowl, for at least one hour. The crackers should be
almost clear and soft as jelly, but not broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>Eat from the bowl, with more sugar sprinkled in if you

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Jelly.</span> (<i>Very nourishing.</i>) ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Half a raw chicken, pounded with a mallet, bones and meat together.</li>
<li>Plenty of cold water to cover it well—<i>about</i> a quart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat slowly in a covered vessel, and let it simmer until
the meat is in white rags and the liquid reduced one half.
Strain and press, first through a cullender, then through a
coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper, if you think best;
return to the fire, and simmer five minutes longer. Skim

improves the broth.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>Slices of toast, nicely browned, without a symptom of burning.</li>

If the physician thinks it safe, add a little lemon-juice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Water.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 large juicy pippin, the most finely-flavored you can get.</li>
<li>3 cups of cold water—1 quart if the apple is very large.</li>

on the fire in a tin or porcelain saucepan with the water,
and boil, closely covered, until the apple stews to pieces.

<li>1 quart <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
<li>2 lemons—the juice only.</li>
<li>1 glass of wine.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful cinnamon. (Measure scantily.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the washed moss in a very little cold water; stir

<h3><span class="smcap">Dry Toast.</span></h3>

inch thick and toast <i>quickly</i>. Graham bread is very nice
toasted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Milk Toast.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Toast as just directed; dip each slice, as it comes from
the toaster, in boiling water; butter, salt slightly, and lay
in a deep covered dish. Have ready in a saucepan enough
boiling milk to cover all well. When your slices are
packed, salt this very slightly; melt in it a bit of butter
and pour over them. Cover closely and let it stand five
minutes before using it. It is excellent when made of
Graham bread.</p>

<p>This is a good dish for a family tea as well as for invalids.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Unleavened Biscuit, or Wafers.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Mix good, dry flour to a stiff dough with milk; salt,

again almost as thin as letter-paper. Bake very quickly.</p>

<p>They may also be mixed with water. These are very
simple and palatable, and go well with all kinds of broth,
especially oyster-soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dried Rusk.</span> (See <i><a href="#BREAD">Bread</a></i>.)</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Steak and Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Choose the tenderest cuts and broil over a clear hot fire
with your wisest skill. Let the steak be rare—the chops
well-done. Salt and pepper, lay between two <i>hot</i> plates
three minutes, and serve to your patient. If he is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
weak, do not let him swallow anything except the juice,
when he has chewed the meat well.</p>

<p>The essence of rare beef—roast or broiled—thus expressed,
is considered by some physicians to be more
strengthening than beef-tea, prepared in the usual manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sangaree or Porteree.</span></h3>

<p>One-third wine or porter mixed with two-thirds cold
water. Sweeten, grate nutmeg on the top, and ice.</p>

<li>1 pint boiling milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 large glass pale wine, poured in when the milk is

curd forms, draw off the whey and sweeten.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Herb Teas</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Are made by infusing the dried or green leaves and stalks
in boiling water, and letting them stand until cold.
Sweeten to taste.</p>

<p>Sage tea, sweetened with honey, is good for a sore
throat, used as a gargle, with a small bit of alum dissolved
in it.</p>

<p>Catnip tea is the best panacea for infant ills, in the way
of cold and colic, known to nurses.</p>

<p>Pennyroyal tea will often avert the unpleasant consequences
of a sudden check of perspiration, or the evils induced
by ladies’ thin shoes.</p>

<p>Chamomile and gentian teas are excellent tonics taken
either cold or hot.</p>

<p>The tea made from blackberry-root is said to be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
for summer disorders. That from green strawberry leaves
is an admirable and soothing wash for a cankered mouth.</p>

<p>Tea of parsley-root scraped and steeped in boiling water,
taken warm, will often cure strangury and kindred affections,
as will that made from dried pumpkin-seed.</p>

<p>Tansy and rue teas are useful in cases of colic, as are
fennel seeds steeped in brandy.</p>

<p>A tea of damask-rose leaves, dry or fresh, will usually
subdue any simple case of summer complaint in infants.</p>

<p>Mint tea, made from the green leaves, crushed in cold
or hot water and sweetened, is palatable and healing to
the stomach and bowels.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mint Julep.</span> ✠</h3>

<p>Some sprigs of green mint, slightly bruised in a tumbler
with a teaspoon. Put in a generous teaspoonful of white
sugar; add gradually, stirring and rubbing lightly, enough
water to fill the glass three-quarters of the way to the top.
Fill up with pounded ice; stir hard; pour into a larger

<h2>THE NURSERY.</h2>

<p>All food intended for infants should be very thoroughly
cooked. The numerous varieties of farinaceous substances—biscotine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
farina, rice-flour, arrowroot, etc., however
nourishing may be their properties when rightly
prepared, are harsh and drastic when underdone. Unless
you have a nurse whom you know for yourself to be faithful
and experienced, always superintend the cooking of
baby’s food. It can do no harm—it may prevent much—if
you examine it every day to see that it is right as to
quality and quantity. Do not aim at variety in this
branch of your profession. Confine a child under three
years of age to a very limited bill of fare. His stomach
is too delicate an organ to be tampered with. Let milk—scalded
or boiled, as a rule—be the staple, mixed with
farina, barley, or something of the sort. Let him munch
Graham bread and light crackers freely. Remove far
from him hot bread and griddle-cakes. When he has cut
his carnivorous teeth, Nature says—“This creature wants
meat.” And Nature’s supply is seldom in advance of the
demand. If he did not need what the teeth are designed
to chew, you may be sure they would not be given him.
Grant him the novel food sparingly and with discretion
as to kind. Rare beef and well-boiled mutton, tender
roast or boiled chicken and turkey are safe. Withhold
fried meats of every description. Do not let him touch
veal or pork in any shape. Mince the meat very finely to
save his digestive apparatus all unnecessary work. Mealy
old potatoes—<i>never</i> new or waxy—young onions, boiled
in two waters; fresh asparagus, green peas, and dry sweet
potatoes should suffice for vegetables, with, of course, rice
and hominy. For dessert, once in a while, a simple
custard, a taste of home-made ice-cream, rice and farina
puddings, Graham hasty pudding; the inner part of a
well-roasted apple, and, in their season, ripe peaches and
apples, will not harm him, taken in moderation, if he be
well and strong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pare the fruit always.</i> The skin of an apple is as bad
for him as a bit of your kid gloves would be; that of a
grape more indigestible than sole-leather. Raisins—“skins
and all”—are unfit for anybody to eat. Pulp and
pits, they are poisonous for baby. Ditto, pickles, pastry,
and preserves. Ditto, most kinds of cake and all sorts of
fruit puddings.</p>

<p>Give him light suppers, and put him to bed early in a
dark room. He will not grow better in a glare of artificial
light than will your camellias and azalias.</p>

<p>Always see for yourself that his last waking thoughts
are pleasant; that he shuts his eyes at peace with the
world and in love with you; that his feet are warm, his
stomach easy, and his body not overloaded with blankets
and quilts; also, that the nursery is clean and freshly
aired. These are better prescriptions for sound slumber
than all the old wives’ fables of the excellent properties of
that pernicious drug—Soothing Syrup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Farina.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
<li>1 cup fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 large tablespoonful Hecker’s Farina, wet up with cold water.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the farina into the boiling water (<i>slightly</i> salted) in
the farina kettle (<i>i. e.</i>, one boiler set within another, the
latter filled with hot water). Boil fifteen minutes, stirring
constantly until it is well-thickened. Then add the milk,
stirring it in gradually, and boil fifteen minutes longer.
Sweeten, and give to the child so soon as it is cool enough.</p>

<p>You may make enough in the morning to last all day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
warming it up with a little hot milk as you want it. Keep
in a cold place. Some of the finest children I have ever
seen were reared upon this diet. Do not get it too sweet,
and cook it well. Be sure the farina is sweet and dry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Barley.</span></h3>

<p>It sometimes happens that milk disagrees with a delicate
infant so seriously that it is necessary to substitute
some other article of diet for a few days. I have known
barley water to be used, in such cases, with great success.</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 cups <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls pearl barley—picked over and washed.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls white sugar—<i>not</i> heaping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the barley half an hour in a very little lukewarm
water, and stir, without draining, into the boiling water,
salted very slightly. Simmer one hour, stirring often, and
strain before sweetening.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 cup fresh milk.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls best Bermuda arrowroot, wet with cold water.</li>
<li>1 <i>small</i> pinch of salt.</li>
<li>2 even teaspoonfuls white sugar, dissolved in the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the arrowroot paste into the salted boiling water;
stir and boil five minutes or until it is clear; add the
sweetened milk, and boil ten minutes, slowly, still stirring.</p>

<p>If the child has fever, or cannot digest milk, substitute
hot water for it. It is, however, a dangerous experiment
to forbid milk altogether for an infant. I should rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
diminish the quantity, putting in, say, one-third or one-fourth
as much as the receipt names, and filling up with
boiling water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Jelly.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ cup whole rice, well-washed and soaked two hours in a little warm water; then added, with the water, to that in the kettle.</li>
<li>3 pints cold water.</li>
<li>1 small pinch of salt, put into the water.</li>
<li>Sweeten to taste with loaf sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer the rice half an hour; then boil it until it is a
smooth paste, and the water is reduced one-half. Strain
through double tarlatan, sweeten, and give to the child.</p>

<p>This is an admirable preparation for an infant suffering
with weakness of the bowels. If there is no fever, you may
put one-third part milk, boiled with the rice. Give a few
spoonfuls every hour or half hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milk and Bread.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup boiled milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls stale Graham bread.</li>
<li>A very little sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crumble the bread into the boiled milk, sweeten, and
when cool enough, feed to the child with a spoon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wheaten Grits.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls grits (cracked wheat) soaked in a little cold water one hour, and then put into the kettle.</li>
<li>1 quart boiling water.</li>
<li>1 cup milk.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the soaked grits in the quart of water one hour,
stirring up often; add the milk and boil half an hour
longer. Sweeten to taste, and if the child is well, pour
cream over it. This is designed for children over a year
old. It is slightly cathartic; especially if the milk be
omitted, and is most useful in regulating the bowels.
When this can be done without drugs, it is far better.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy and Milk.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ cup <i>small</i> hominy.</li>
<li>1 scant quart of cold water.</li>
<li>Pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil one hour, stirring often. While hot, mix some
soft with new milk, sweeten to taste and feed to baby with
a spoon.</p>

<p>This is also relaxing to the bowels, and should not be
given if the child is disposed to summer complaint.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Hasty Pudding.</span> ✠</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup Graham flour, wet up with cold water.</li>
<li>1 large cup <i>boiling</i> water and same quantity of milk.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the wet flour into the boiling water, slightly salted.
Boil fifteen minutes, stirring almost constantly. Add the
milk and cook, after it has come again to a boil, ten minutes
longer. Give with sugar and milk for breakfast.</p>

<p>Eaten with cream, nutmeg, and powdered sugar, this is
a good plain dessert for grown people as well as children.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Flour Hasty Pudding</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is made as above, substituting two heaping tablespoonfuls
rice flour for the Graham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milk Porridge.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 tablespoonful Indian meal } wet to a paste with cold</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white flour }   water.</li>
<li>2 cups boiling water.</li>
<li>2 cups milk.</li>
<li>A <i>good</i> pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the paste in the hot water twenty minutes; add the
milk and cook ten minutes more, stirring often.</p>

<p>Eat with sugar and milk, stirred in while hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mush and Milk.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup Indian meal, wet up with cold water.</li>
<li>2 quarts cold water.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil two hours; stirring often with a wooden spoon or a
stick.</p>

<p>To be eaten hot with milk and sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Condensed Milk.</span></h3>

<p>This is perhaps the safest substitute for the “good milk
from one cow,” which few mothers in town can procure.
Keep the can in a cool place and mix according to directions.</p>


<hr class="chap" />


<h2>SUNDRIES.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cleaning Pots, Kettles, and Tins.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a double handful of hay or grass in a new iron pot,
before attempting to cook with it; scrub out with soap and
sand; then set on full of fair water, and let it boil half an
hour. After this, you may use it without fear. As soon
as you empty a pot or frying-pan of that which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
cooked in it, fill with hot or cold water (hot is best) and
set back upon the fire to scald thoroughly.</p>

<p>New tins should stand near the fire with boiling water
in them, in which has been dissolved a spoonful of soda,
for an hour; then be scoured inside with soft soap; afterward
rinsed with hot water. Keep them clean by rubbing
with sifted <i>wood</i>-ashes, or whitening.</p>

<p>Copper utensils should be cleaned with brickdust and
flannel.</p>

<p>Never set a vessel in the pot-closet without cleaning
and wiping it thoroughly. If grease be left in it, it will
grow rancid. If set aside wet, it is apt to rust.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Knives.</span></h3>

<p>Clean with a soft flannel and Bath brick. If rusty, use
wood-ashes, rubbed on with a newly cut bit of Irish potato.
This will remove spots when nothing else will. Keep
your best set wrapped in <i>soft</i> white paper; then in linen,
in a drawer out of damp and dust.</p>

<p>Never dip the ivory handles of knives in hot water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Silver.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, after each meal, all that is soiled, in <i>very</i> hot soft
water, with hard soap. Wipe hard and quickly on a
clean towel; then polish with dry flannel. If discolored
with egg, mustard, spinach, or beans, by any other means,
rub out the stain with a stiff toothbrush (used only for
this purpose), and silver soap.</p>

<p>For years I have used no other preparation for cleaning
silver than the Indexical silver soap, applied as I have
described. After rubbing with a stiff lather made with
this, wash off with hot water, wipe and polish while hot.
There is no need for the weekly silver cleaning to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
event or a bugbear, if a little care and watchfulness be
observed after each meal. Silver should never be allowed
to grow dingy. If Bridget or Chloe will <i>not</i> attend properly
to this matter, take it in hand yourself. Have your
own soap-cups—two of them—one with common soap, the
other with a cake of silver soap in the bottom. Have for
one a mop, for the other a stiff brush—a toothbrush is best.
Use your softest towels for silver.</p>

<p>Besides being clean and easy of application, the silver
soap will not wear away the metal as will whiting or
chalk, or plate-powder, however finely pulverized.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">China and Glass.</span></h3>

<p>There are few of the minor crooks in the lot of the
careful housewife that cause her more anxiety and more
discouragement than the attempt to teach domestics how
to wash up dishes.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that Mrs. —— is very <i>exact</i> about some
things, such as washing up dishes and the likes of that!”
said a woman to me, with an affected laugh, having called
to apply for the then vacant position of cook in my kitchen.
She had high recommendations, a whine engrafted upon
her native brogue, and spoke of me in the third person—a
trick of cheap (and bogus) gentility that tries my nerves
and temper to the very marrow of my spine. “I was
a-saying to myself, as I came along, that Mrs. —— must
have been <i>very</i> onlucky in her girls if she had to tache
them how to wash up dishes. I always thought that was
one of the things that came <i>kinder nat’ral</i> to every cook.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. ——’s” experience goes to prove that the wrong
way of doing this must “come natural” to the class mentioned,
and that Nature is mighty in woman. The fact
that the right way is <i>not</i> to pile unrinsed dishes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
plates in a big pan with a loose bit of soap on top, and
pour lukewarm water over all; then with a bit of rag to
splash said water over each separately, and make another
pile of them upon the kitchen-table, until the last is drawn,
reeking with liquid grease, sticky and streaming, from the
now filthy puddle of diluted swill; then to rub them lightly
and leisurely with one towel—be they many or few—is as
difficult of comprehension to the scullionly mind as would
be a familiar lecture upon the <i>pons asinorum</i>.</p>

<p>Yet the right and only neat method is so simple and
easy! Rinse the greasy plates, and whatever is sticky
with sugar or other sweet, in hot water and transfer to a
larger pan of <i>very</i> hot. Wash glass first; next silver;
then china—one article at a time, although you may put
several in the pan. Have a mop with a handle; rub
upon the soap (over which the water should have been
poured) until you have strong suds. There is a little implement
made by the “Dover Stamping Co.,” a cup of tinned
wire, called a “soap-shaker,” that greatly facilitates this
process of suds-making, without waste of soap. Wash
both sides of plate and saucer, and wipe <i>before putting it
out of your hand</i>. Draining leaves streaks which can be
felt by sensitive finger-tips, if not seen. If china is rough
to the touch, it is dirty. Hot, clean suds, a dry, clean
towel, and quick wiping leave it bright and shining.
Roll your glasses around in the water, filling them as soon
as they touch it, and you need never crack one. A lady
did once explain the dinginess of her goblets to me by saying
that she was “afraid to put them in hot water. It
<i>rots</i> glass and makes it so tender! I prefer to have them
a little cloudy.” This is literally true—that she said it, I
mean. Certainly not that a year’s soak in hot water
could make glass tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Washing Windows.</span></h3>

<p>Dissolve a little washing-soda in the water if the glass
is very dim with smoke or dirt. Do not let it run on the
sash, but wash each pane with old flannel; dry quickly
with a soft, clean towel, wiping the corners with especial
care. Polish with chamois skin, or newspapers rubbed
soft between the hands.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean Carpets.</span></h3>

<p>Sprinkle the carpet with tea-leaves; sweep well; then
use soap and soft, warm water for the grease and dirt
spots. This freshens up old carpets marvellously. Rub
the wet spots dry with a clean cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean Paint.</span></h3>

<p>Scour with a flat brush, less harsh than that used for
floors, using warm soft suds; before it dries wash off with
old flannel dipped in clean cold water, and wipe dry
with a linen towel or cloth. Go through the whole process
quickly, that the water may not dry upon and streak
the paint.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Keep Woolens.</span></h3>

<p>Beat out all the dust, and sun for a day; shake very
hard; fold neatly and pin—or, what is better, sew up—closely
in muslin or linen cloths, putting a small lump of
gum-camphor in the centre of each bundle. Wrap newspapers
about all, pinning so as to exclude dust and insects.</p>

<p>These are really all the precautions necessary for the
safety even of furs, if they are strictly obeyed. But you
may set moths at defiance if you can, in addition to
these, secure, as a packing-case, a whiskey or alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
barrel, but lately emptied, and still strongly scented by the
liquor. Have a close head, and fit it in neatly. Set away
in the garret, and think no more of your treasures until
next winter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Wash Doubtful Calicoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put a teaspoonful of sugar of lead into a pailful of
water, and soak fifteen minutes before washing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean a Cloth Coat.</span></h3>

<p>Rub soap upon the wristbands and collar; dip them in
boiling-hot suds—and scrub with a stiff clean brush.
Treat the grease and dirt spots in the same way. Change
the suds for clean and hot as it gets dirty. Wet and
brush the whole coat, the right way of the cloth, with
fresh suds, when you have scoured out the spots, adding
three or four tablespoonfuls of alcohol to the water.
Stretch the sleeves, pocket-holes, wristbands, and collar
into shape, folding the sleeves as if they had been ironed,
also the collar. Lay upon a clean cloth, spread upon the
table or floor, and let it get perfectly dry in the shade,
turning over three or four times without disturbing the
folds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean Silk.</span></h3>

<p><i>To Remove Grease Spots.</i>—Scrape Venetian or French
chalk fine; moisten to a stiff paste with soap-suds; make
it into flat cakes by pressing between two boards, and dry
in the sun or oven. Keep these for use. When you need
them, scrape one to powder and cover the spot with it,
laying the silk upon a fine clean linen or cotton cloth.
Lay two or three folds of tissue-paper upon the chalk, and
press it with a hot iron for a minute or more, taking care
it does not touch the silk. Raise the paper and scrape off
the grease with the chalk. Split a visiting-card, and rub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
the place where the spot <i>was</i>, with the inside, to restore
the lustre. The silk should be pressed on the wrong
side.</p>

<p>If the spot be discovered at once, simply rub the wrong
side hard with powdered French chalk, and leave it to
wear off.</p>

<p><i>To Wash Silk.</i>—Mix together</p>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 cups cold water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful honey.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful soft soap.</li>
<li>1 wineglass alcohol.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake up well; lay the silk, a breadth at a time, on a
table, and sponge both sides with this, rubbing it well in;
shake it about well and up and down in a tub of cold water;
flap it as dry as you can, but do not wring it. Hang
it by the edges, not the middle, until fit to iron. Iron
on the wrong side while it is very damp.</p>

<p>Black and dark or sober-colored silks may be successfully
treated in this way.</p>

<p><i>To Smooth Wrinkled Silk.</i>—Sponge on the right side
with very weak gum-arabic water, and iron on the wrong
side.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Renew Wrinkled Crape.</span></h3>

<p>Stretch over a basin of boiling water, holding it smooth,
but not tight, over the top, and shifting as the steam fairly
penetrates it. Fold, while damp, in the original creases,
and lay under a heavy book or board to dry. It will look
almost as well as new.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Restore the Pile of Velvet.</span></h3>

<p>If but slightly pressed, treat as you would crape. Steam
on the right side until heated through. If very badly
crushed, wet on the wrong side; let an assistant hold a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
iron, bottom upward, and pass the wet side of the velvet
slowly over the flat surface—a sort of upside-down ironing.
When the steam rises thickly through to the right
side, it will raise the pile with it. Dry without handling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Curl Tumbled Feathers.</span></h3>

<p>Hold over the heated top of the range or stove, not near
enough to burn; withdraw, shake them out, and hold
them over it again until curled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean Straw Matting.</span></h3>

<p>Wash with a cloth dipped in clean salt and water;
then wipe dry at once. This prevents it from turning
yellow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Wash Lawn or Thin Muslin.</span></h3>

<p>Boil two quarts of wheat-bran in six quarts, or more, of
water, half an hour. Strain through a coarse towel and
mix in the water in which the muslin is to be washed.
Use no soap, if you can help it, and no starch. Rinse
lightly in fair water. This preparation both cleanses and
stiffens the lawn. If you can conveniently, take out all
the gathers. The skirt should always be ripped from the
waist.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Wash Woolens.</span></h3>

<p>Wash in clean, hot soap suds; rinse out in clear, hot
water, and shake out the wet without passing through the
wringer. Worsted dress-goods should never be wrung
when washed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Wash White Lace Edging.</span></h3>

<p>Have a quart bottle covered with linen, stitched smoothly
to fit the shape. Begin at the bottom and wind the lace
about it, basting fast at both edges, even the minutest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
point, to the linen. Wash on the bottle, soaping it well,
rinse by plunging in a pail of fair water, and boil as you
would a white handkerchief, bottle and all. Set in the
hot sun to dry. When quite dry, clip the basting-threads,
and use the lace without ironing. If neatly basted on, it
will look nearly as well as new—if not quite.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Black Lace.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>½ cup rain water, or very soft spring water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful borax.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful spirits of wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Squeeze the tumbled rusty lace through this four times,
then rinse in a cup of hot water in which a black kid glove
has been boiled. Pull out the edges of the lace until
almost dry; then press for two days between the leaves of
a heavy book.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Sponge Black Worsted Dresses.</span></h3>

<p>Sponge on the right side with a strong tea made of <i>fig
leaves</i>, and iron on the wrong.</p>

<p>This process restores lustre and crispness to alpaca,
bombazine, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean very Dirty Black Dresses.</span></h3>

<p>2 parts soft water to 1 part alcohol, or if there be paint
spots upon the stuff, spirits turpentine. Soap a sponge
well, dip in the mixture and rub, a breadth at a time, on
both sides, stretching it upon a table. Iron on the wrong
side, or that which is to be inside when the stuff is made
up. Sponge off with fair water, hot but not scalding, <i>before
you iron</i>. Iron while damp.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Remove Stains from Marble.</span></h3>

<p>Make a mortar of unslacked lime and very strong lye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
Cover the spot thickly with it and leave it on for six weeks.
Wash it off perfectly clean, and rub <i>hard</i> with a brush
dipped in a lather of soap and water. Polish with a
smooth, hard brush.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iron Mould</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is as nearly ineradicable as it is possible for stain to be.
<i>Try</i> moistening the part injured with ink, and while this
is wet, rub in muriatic acid diluted with five times its
weight of water. I have heard that the old and new stain
can sometimes be removed together by this operation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mildew</span></h3>

<p class='unindent'>Is likewise obstinate. If anything will extract it, it is
lemon-juice mixed with an equal weight of salt, powdered
starch, and soft soap. Rub on thickly and lay upon the
grass in the hot sun; renewing the application two or
three times a day until the spot fades or comes out.</p>

<p>I have also used salt wet with tomato-juice, often renewed,
laying the article stained upon the grass. Sometimes
the stain was taken out, sometimes not.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ink.</span></h3>

<p>While the stains are yet wet upon the carpet, sponge
them with skim-milk <i>thoroughly</i>. Then wash out the milk
with a clean sponge dipped again and again in fair water,
cold. Exchange this presently for warm; then rub dry
with a cloth. If the stain is upon any article of clothing,
or table, or bed linen, wash in the milk well, afterward in
the water.</p>

<p><i>Dry</i> ink stains can be removed from white cloth by
oxalic acid, or lemon-juice and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stains of Acids and Alkalies.</span></h3>

<p>Treat acid stains with hartshorn; alkaline with acids.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
For instance, if the color be taken out of cloth by whitewash,
wash with strong vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grease Spots.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 quart boiling water.</li>
<li>1 oz. pulverized borax.</li>
<li>½ oz. of gum camphor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake up well and bottle. It is excellent for removing
grease spots from woolens.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cure for Burns.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>One-third part linseed oil.</li>
<li>Two-thirds lime water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake up well; apply and wrap in soft linen.</p>

<p>Until you can procure this keep the part covered with
<i>wood-soot</i> mixed to a soft paste with lard, <i>or</i>, if you have
not these, with common molasses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Stop the Flow of Blood.</span></h3>

<p>Bind the cut with cobwebs and brown sugar, pressed on
like lint. <i>Or</i>, if you cannot procure these, with the fine
dust of tea. When the blood ceases to flow, apply laudanum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Relieve Asthma.</span></h3>

<p>Soak blotting or tissue paper in <i>strong</i> saltpetre water.
Dry, and burn at night in your bed-room.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> this to be an excellent prescription.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Antidotes to Poison.</span></h3>

<p>For <i>any</i> poison swallow instantly a glass of cold water
with a heaping teaspoonful of common salt and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
ground mustard stirred in. This is a speedy emetic.
When it has acted, swallow the whites of two raw eggs.</p>

<p>If you have taken corrosive sublimate take half a dozen
raw eggs besides the emetic. If laudanum, a cup of <i>very</i>
strong coffee. If arsenic, first the emetic, then half a cup
of sweet oil or melted lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cologne Water.</span> (<i>Fine.</i>) (<i>No. 1.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 drachm oil lavender.</li>
<li>1 drachm oil bergamot.</li>
<li>2 drachm oil lemon.</li>
<li>2 drachm oil rosemary.</li>
<li>50 drops tincture of musk.</li>
<li>8 drops oil of cinnamon.</li>
<li>8 drops oil of cloves.</li>
<li>1 pint of alcohol.</li>
</ul>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cologne Water.</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>)</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>60 drops oil of lavender.</li>
<li>60 drops oil of bergamot.</li>
<li>60 drops oil of lemon.</li>
<li>60 drops orange-flower water.</li>
<li>1 pint of alcohol.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cork and shake well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hard Soap.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>6 lbs. washing soda.</li>
<li>3 lbs. unslaked lime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour on 4 gallons boiling water.</p>

<p>Let it stand until perfectly clear, then drain off. Put
in 6 lbs. clean fat.</p>

<p>Boil until it begins to harden—about two hours—stirring
most of the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<p>While boiling, thin with two gallons of cold water,
which you have poured on the alkaline mixture after
draining off the four gallons. This must also settle clear
before it is drawn off. Add it when there is danger of
boiling over.</p>

<p>Try the thickness by cooling a little on a plate. Put
in a handful of salt just before taking from the fire. Wet
a tub to prevent sticking; turn in the soap and let it
stand until solid. Cut into bars; put on a board and let
it dry.</p>

<p>This will make about forty pounds of nice soap; much
better for washing (when it has dried out for two or three
months) than yellow turpentine soap.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bar Soap.</span></h3>

<p>Buy a box at a time; cut into small squares and lay
upon the garret-floor to dry for several weeks before it is
used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soft Soap.</span></h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>10 lbs. grease.</li>
<li>6 lbs. soda (washing).</li>
<li>8 gallons hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let it stand for several days until the grease is eaten
up. If too thick, add more water. Stir every day. If
wood-ashes are used instead of soda, boil the mixture.</p>

<p>Fond as Americans are of Ice-Cream and Ices, there has never been a
book giving directions for the preparation of the various forms of iced
dainties, some of which are quite unknown in this country, or are only
procurable from the best confectioners of our large cities. This book
contains the fruit of many years’ experience and experiment, together
with a description of the processes followed by the great French and
Italian confectioners.</p>

<p>More than a hundred different receipts for Ice-Creams and Water Ices
are given, with rules for preparing all the various flavorings. The directions
are both minute and systematic, and being the production of a person
of education and refinement, specially qualified for the task, the work
will be found to be thoroughly accurate and complete in all points. Any
capable housewife, with the resources of a well-equipped kitchen, will be
able to follow the directions given, without difficulty and with certainty
of success.</p>

<p>Extreme care has been taken to avoid ambiguity and looseness of statement,
the exact amount of an ingredient is always stated, so that the
most inexperienced cannot go astray. <i>The various utensils necessary
are described, and full advice given as to their use.</i></p>

<p>Following this section is a collection of receipts for Cake, embracing
several hundred different sorts, many of them new and original, and all
carefully tested and of prime excellence. Some of these receipts have
hitherto been the property of individuals by whom they were sold singly
at a high price. The book, as a whole, contains a greater number of original
and choice receipts for ice-cream and cakes than any other in existence.
It will be found indispensable wherever choice and dainty cookery is
appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dinner Year-Book</span> is, in its name, happily descriptive of its purposes and character.
It occupies a place which, amid all the publications upon cookery—and their
name is Legion—<b>has never yet been occupied</b>.</p>

<p>The author truly says that there have been <i>dinner-giving</i> books published, that is,
books of <i>menus</i> for company dinings, “Little Dinners,” for especial occasions, etc., etc.;
but that she has never yet met with a <b>practical directory</b> of this important meal
<b>for every day in the year</b>. In this volume she has furnished the programme
in all its details, and has superintended the preparation of each dish, proceeding even to
the proper manner of serving it at table. <b>The book has been prepared for
the family, for the home of ordinary means, and it has hit the
happy line where elegance and economy meet.</b></p>

<p>The most numerous testimonials to the value of Marion Harland’s “Common Sense”
books which the publishers have received, both in newspaper notices and in private
communications, are to the effect—always expressed with some astonishment—that <b>the
directions of these receipts, actually followed, produce the promised
result</b>. We can prophesy the same for the new volume.</p>

<p>The purchaser will find that he has bought what the name purports—<i>The Dinner
Year-Book</i>—a practical guide for the purchase of the material and preparation, serving,
etc. of the ordinary home dinner for every day of the year. To these are added
<b>twelve company dinners</b>, one for each month, from which a selection can be
made—according to the time of the year—equal to any occasion which will be presented
to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>This book, however, is not valuable merely as a directory for dinners appropriate to
various seasons. It contains <b>the largest number of receipts</b> for soups, fish,
meat, vegetables, entrees of all descriptions, and desserts, <b>ever offered to the
American public</b>. The material for this work has been collected with great care
both at home and abroad, representing the diligent labor of many months.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stockton has rare gifts for this style of writing, and has
developed in these papers remarkable genius.”—<i>Pittsburgh Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“A certain humorous seriousness over matters that are not serious
surrounds the story, even in its most indifferent parts, with an atmosphere,
an aroma of very quaint and delightful humor.”—<i>N. Y. Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Stockton’s vein of humor is a fresh and rich one, that affords
pleasure to mature people as well as to young ones. Thus far, ‘Rudder
Grange’ is his best effort.”—<i>Philadelphia Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>“Rudder Grange is an ideal book to take into the country for
summer reading.”—<i>Portland Press.</i></p>

<p>“Rudder Grange is really a very delightful piece of fooling, but, like
all fooling that is worth the while, it has point and purpose.”—<i>Phil.
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“The odd conceit of making his young couple try their hands at
house-keeping first in an old canal boat, suggests many droll situations,
which the author improves with a frolicsome humor that is all his own.”—<i>Worcester
Spy.</i></p>

<p>“There is in these chapters a rare and captivating drollery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We have had more pleasure in reading them over again than we had when
they first appeared in the magazine.”—<i>Congregationalist.</i></p></div>
